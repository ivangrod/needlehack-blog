    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-09-12th-anniversary/art.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Home Assistant 12th Anniversary">
<p>Every September, we celebrate the anniversary of Home Assistant’s first PR in 2013 – for our 12th birthday, we’re going all in on community again. Last month, we asked for submissions on how Home Assistant helps you, and today we will highlight our favorites! We will also take a look at all the cool milestones over the past year in the project, thanks to contributions from you all, and the new things coming up for the community. <!--more--></p>
<h2>It’s a communal effort</h2>
<p>When I (Missy Quarry) joined as the Community &amp; Social Media Manager in February 2024, I was still new to how an open source project the size of Home Assistant manages its community. Over the past 18 months, I’ve seen Home Assistant community members from all walks of life — whether DIY tinkerers or people simply looking to make small improvements at home — contribute in their own ways. By sharing your stories and inspiring others, you’ve helped the project grow.  For our 12th birthday, I want to celebrate these contributions, no matter the size or complexity. 😌</p>
<p>Before I jump into celebrating all your amazing contributions and how they shape the projects managed by the Open Home Foundation, I have a couple of birthday presents for you. 🎁</p>
<p>First, I’m thrilled to share our <a href="/community">new Community website</a>! Right now, it’s a simple hub to find community information with ease, but we expect to evolve this over the coming months (or so). You’ll find links to our official community platforms, information on events, and details on meetups, including how to get reimbursed for certain fees as a host. In the future, I’d like to include links to regional communities we’re aware of and showcase more of the kinds of stories I’ll be sharing today.</p>
<p><em>Feel like something’s missing from this new page? <a href="mailto:community@openhomefoundation.org">Let me know</a>!</em></p>
<p>Next, we’ve been working hard to do more of our development in the open. Last September, I redesigned the Discord server and in doing so I gated the <em>Developer</em> category behind a role. This has made it more difficult to develop in the open with the channels hidden behind a role, so we’re switching things up.</p>
<p>As of this week, the Developer category is now <strong>read-only</strong> for every member. Want to take a peek into the future of Home Assistant? Head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1346914401508392980">#projects channel</a> and see what contributors are talking about! Want to join in and contribute with either your feedback or skills? I’ve created <a href="https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1346952081881436331">an info thread</a> for the channel that explains how to assign yourself either the Developer or Designer role and unlock the ability to chat in the threads.</p>
<p>Let’s jump into those submitted stories now… 🤩</p>
<h2>Happily ever after</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the best thing about Home Assistant is its flexibility - you can integrate such a wide range of devices into it and use their data to build a unique-to-your-home experience. And that’s exactly why I wanted to hear how you, the community, use it in your own home to benefit you. Here are my favorite stories you submitted - I hope one inspires your next project. ✨</p>

<p>Several years ago, HillPhantom found that Home Assistant wasn’t quite ready for him. Over the past year, though, he’s now got Ollama set up with his Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition and has been building guides on how to make your own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb-4l93st8A">mmWave radar sensors in Home Assistant</a>. 👋🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over just a few weeks, Pieter van Kampen recently integrated 190 devices that respond to voice control and more than 1200 active entities from his KNX home to create over 30 automations to help with everything from mowing the lawn to controlling shades based on the sun’s location and intensity. 🪟</p>

<li>
<p>MB used Zigbee buttons to help collect data for their son’s doctor after he developed some trouble sleeping. This gave excellent insight for the doctor to start looking into causes, and they even used the system remotely while doing further evaluation. 📈</p>

<p>Graham Hosking took automations to another level (before we did) with his <a href="https://github.com/ITSpecialist111/ai_automation_suggester">AI Automation Suggester</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ITSpecialist111/Automation-Inspector">Automation Inspector</a>. It takes the load off your brain by helping come up with new, clever automations! 🤖</p>

<li>
<p>Wessam Lauf fell down the rabbit hole that is Home Assistant once he got his setup running. Inspired by the Graphite theme and after some LLM vibe-coding, he wrote a template for his very own theme, <a href="https://github.com/wessamlauf/homeassistant-frosted-glass-themes">Frosted Glass</a> - now available in <a href="https://www.hacs.xyz/">HACS</a>. 🎨</p>

<p>Too many of us anthropomorphize our homes, telling it to chill out when five things break the same day. Biofects took that to heart and created this <a href="https://streamable.com/hnoc63">Home Assistant avatar</a> for his home (here’s a bonus, nightmare fuel <a href="https://streamable.com/xah2va">first version</a>). 🫣</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developers! 👏🏻 Developers! 👏🏻 Developers! 👏🏻</h2>
<p>Our community is more than developers, it’s true. But we wouldn’t be the <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/">largest open source project</a> on GitHub if we didn’t have a vibrant and active developer community. This ship sails largely due to their contributions, and we genuinely appreciate all of their efforts.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re eager to interview community members when we open new roles at the foundation. We’ve employed community members like <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">Joostlek</a> (who designed the new <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/integration-quality-scale/">Integration Quality Scale</a> and helps onboard new integrations into Core), <a href="https://github.com/TimoPtr">Timo</a> (who is our first ever Android developer and has focused on <a href="/blog/2025/07/23/companion-app-for-android/">polishing the Android app</a>), and <a href="https://github.com/maximmaxim345">Maxim</a> (a talented developer from the Music Assistant community who works on both Music Assistant and ESPHome and is one of our newest additions to the team). Their contributions have helped shape how things work around here, but it was their contributions as community members that helped pave the way for their joining the foundation. These are just a select few of the <em>several</em> new hires at the foundation who were active community members.</p>
<p>(Have you checked our <a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/openhomefoundation/">jobs page</a> recently to see what roles are open? 👀)</p>
<p>With our community of contributors and working with Nabu Casa on the hardware design, we have successfully launched a few new pieces of hardware. The <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a> brought in language experts from every corner of the world to help ensure our language coverage is the most robust in the industry. Thanks to contributors, we support languages like Greek, Icelandic, and more recently Irish Gaeilge! 😎 We had community contributors help make sure the Home Assistant <a href="/connect/zwa-2/">Connect ZWA-2</a> was prepared for launch last month. Sincerely, we couldn’t be more grateful for your support and efforts in these spaces.</p>
<p>Here are some fun stats from our GitHub contributors (<a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/graphs/contributors?from=9%2F9%2F2023">commits on our Core repo</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Last 12 months (Sept - Aug) - 14,385</li>
<li>Previous 12 months - 14,503</li>
</ul>
<p>A SPECIAL CONGRATULATIONS to <a href="https://github.com/bdraco">bdraco</a>, who just last week surpassed <a href="https://github.com/balloob">balloob</a> (the founder of Home Assistant) as the contributor with the most commits!</p>
<div class="contain nb">
    <img src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09-12th-anniversary/contributors.webp" alt="Top 8 contributors of all time for home-assistant/core" style="width:100%;max-width:700px;">
    The top 8 contributors of all time in home-assistant/core👏🏻
</div>
<p>This is just a small peek into all the hard work that goes into maintaining Home Assistant - we have more repositories than just Core, and every single contribution is valued.</p>
<p>Honorable dev mention from the submitted community stories - I couldn’t leave Joostlek’s (joke) submission out. 🤣</p>
<ul>
<li>Our very own Head of Developer Relations (his words), Joost Lekkerkerker, says Home Assistant helps keep him off the street. He’s just launched <a href="https://joostlek.dev/what-is-a-smart-home/">his new blog</a> that talks about his vision of a smart home, and how he was inspired to not buy Tuya Wi-Fi lights after seeing my experience with some path lights.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our humble gratitude</h2>
<p>Community is the core of what we do and the heart of Home Assistant. We thrive because you care and contribute your valuable time to support our collective success. Whether you found our platform because you wanted more privacy from big tech, were intrigued by the number of choices implemented into a single app, or needed something to track your sustainability efforts — you support our values every day. Thanks for choosing us, and thank you for all you do to help support the foundation and the projects we maintain.</p>
<p>A very special thanks to all our <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers and anyone who has purchased our official Home Assistant hardware. These support the full-time development of Home Assistant (along with ESPHome, Music Assistant, and so much more), and are the easiest way to ensure these projects keep getting cool new features!</p>
<p>We have more things coming down the line for you. In the near future, we plan on announcing a new merch store 👕. In the first half of next year, I’ll announce when Home Assistant Community Day 2026 will be. We’re already working with Nabu Casa on the next exciting hardware announcement (no spoilers…for now). And that’s not even touching the industry events we plan on attending, the State of the Open Home, and so much more. I’m excited to take you all on the journey we’re already working on over the next 12 months, and I’m always looking forward to another year of amazing contributions. 😌</p>

    <updated>2025-09-11T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/09/11/ai-in-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-09-ai/art.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Building the AI-powered local smart home">
<p>Last year, we laid out <a href="/blog/2024/06/07/ai-agents-for-the-smart-home/">our vision for AI in the smart home</a>, which opened up experimentation with AI in Home Assistant. In that update, we made it easier to integrate all sorts of local and cloud AI tools, and provided ways to use them to control and automate your home. A year has passed, a lot has happened in the AI space, and our community has made sure that Home Assistant has stayed at the frontier.</p>
<p>We beat big tech to the punch; we were the first to make AI useful in the home. We did it by giving our community complete control over how and when they use AI, making AI a powerful <em>tool</em> to use in the home. As opposed to something that takes over your home. Our community is taking advantage of AI’s unique abilities (for instance, its image recognition or summarizing skills), while having the ability to exclude it from mission-critical things they’d prefer it not to handle. Best of all, this can all be run locally, without any data leaving your home!</p>
<p>Moreover, if users don’t want AI in their homes, that’s their choice, and they can choose not to enable any of these features. I hope to see big tech take an approach this measured, but judging by their last couple of keynotes, I’m not holding my breath.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we’ve added many new AI features and made them easy to use directly through Home Assistant’s user interface. We have kept up with all the developments in AI land and are using the latest standard to integrate more models and tools than ever before. We’re also continuing to benchmark local and cloud models to give users an idea of what works best. Keep reading to check out everything new, and maybe you can teach your smart home some cool new tricks.</p>

<h2>Supercharging voice control with AI</h2>
<p>We were doing voice assistants before AI was cool. In 2023, we kicked off our <a href="/blog/2022/12/20/year-of-voice/">Year of the Voice</a>. Since then, we’ve worked towards our goal of building all the parts needed for a local, open, and private voice assistant. When AI became the rage, we were quick to integrate it.</p>
<p>Today, users can chat with any large language model (LLM) that is integrated into Home Assistant, whether that’s in the cloud or run locally via a service like <a href="/integrations/ollama/">Ollama</a>. Where <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a>, our home-grown (non-AI) voice assistant agent, is focused on a predetermined list of mostly home control commands, AI allows you to ask more open-ended questions. Summarize what’s happening across the smart home sensors you’ve <a href="/voice_control/voice_remote_expose_devices/">exposed to Assist</a>, or get answers to trivia questions. You can even <a href="/voice_control/assist_create_open_ai_personality/">give your LLM a personality</a>!</p>
<p>Users can also leverage the power of AI to speak the way <em>they speak</em>, as LLMs are much better at understanding the intent behind the words. By default, Assist will handle commands first. Only questions or commands it can’t understand will be sent to the AI you’ve set up. For instance, <em>“Turn on the kitchen light”</em> can be handled by Assist, while <em>“It’s dark in the kitchen, can you help?”</em> could be processed by an AI. This speeds up response times for simple commands and makes for a more sustainable voice assistant.</p>
<p>Another powerful addition from the past year is context sharing between agents. So your Assist agent can share the most recent commands with your chosen AI agent. This shared context lets you say something like <em>“Add milk to my shopping list,”</em> which Assist will act on, and to add more items, just say <em>“Add rice.”</em> The AI agent understands that these commands are connected and can act accordingly.</p>
<p class="img">
    <lite-youtube videoid="mLtFUG4YG1A" videotitle="Current state of conversational AI - September 2025"></lite-youtube>
    Here is an excellent walkthrough video of JLo's AI-powered home, showing many of these new features in action
</p>
<p>Another helpful addition keeps the conversation going; if the LLM asks you a question, your Assist hardware will listen for your reply. If you say something like “It’s dark”, it might ask whether you’d like to turn on some lights, and you could tell it to proceed. We have taken this even further than other voice assistants, as you can now have Home Assistant initiate conversations. For example, you could set up an automation that detects when the garage door is open and asks if you’d like to close it (though this can also be done without AI with a very clever <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.home-assistant.io%2Fblueprints%2Fblog%2F2025-07%2Fask_yes_no_question.yaml">Blueprint</a>).</p>
<p>AI pushed us to completely revamp our Text-to-Speech (TTS) system to take advantage of streaming responses from LLMs. While local AI models can be slow, we use a simple trick to make the delay almost unnoticeable. Now, both <a href="https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl">Piper</a> (our local TTS) and <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> TTS can begin generating audio as soon as the LLM produces the first few words, improving the speed of the spoken response by a factor of ten.</p>

<h2>Great hardware to work with AI</h2>
<p>People built some really cool voice hardware, from landline telephones to little talking robots, but the fact that it was so DIY was always a barrier to entry. To make our voice assistant available to everyone, we released the <a href="/blog/2024/12/19/voice-preview-edition-the-era-of-open-voice/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>. This is an easy and affordable way to try Home Assistant Voice. It has some seriously powerful audio processing hardware inside its sleek package. If you were on the fence about trying out voice, it really is <a href="/voice-pe/">the best way to get started</a>.</p>
<p class="img">
    <img src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09-ai/voice-pe.webp" style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition">
    Voice Preview Edition is not only open and powerful, but it looks and feels great too!
</p>
<p>It’s now easier than ever to set up your Assist hardware to work with LLMs with our <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/voice_assistants/">Voice Assistants</a> settings page, and you can even assign a different LLM to each device. The LLM can recognize the room it’s in and the devices within it, making its responses more relevant. Assist was built to be a great way to control devices in your home, but with AI, it becomes so much more.</p>
<h2>AI-powered suggestions</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/2025/08/06/release-20258/">Last month</a>, Home Assistant launched a new opt-in feature to leverage the power of AI when automating with Home Assistant. The goal is to shorten the journey from a blank slate to your finished idea.</p>
<p>When saving an automation or script, users can now leverage the new Suggest button: <img src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09-ai/suggest.webp" style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'> When clicked, it will send your automation configuration along with the titles of your existing automations and labels to AI to suggest a name, description, category, and labels for your new automation. Over the coming months, we’re going to explore what other features can benefit from AI suggestions.</p>
<div class="contain nb">
    <img src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09-ai/suggest-button.webp" alt="A rename modal open with the new Suggest button top right">
</div>
<p>To opt-in to this feature, you need to take two steps. First, you need to configure an integration that provides an <a href="/integrations/?cat=ai"><em>AI Tasks</em> entity</a>. For local AI, you can configure Ollama, or you can also leverage cloud-based AI like Google, OpenAI, or Anthropic. Once configured, you need to go to the new <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_ai_task/">AI Task preferences pane</a> under <strong><em>System -&gt; General</em></strong> and pick the AI Task entity to power suggestions in the UI. If you don’t configure an AI Tasks entity, the Suggest button will not be visible.</p>

</div>
<h2>AI Tasks gets the job done</h2>
<p>Enabling <a href="/integrations/ai_task/">AI Tasks</a> does more than quickly label and summarize your automations; its true superpower is making AI easy to use in templates, scripts, and automations. AI Tasks allow other code to leverage AI to generate data, including options to attach files and define how you want that data output (for instance, a JSON schema).</p>
<p>We have all seen those incredible community creations, where a user leverages AI image recognition and analysis to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1lytyv9/parking_spot_detection/">detect available parking spots</a> or <a href="https://houndhillhomestead.com/google-gemini-powered-goose-coop-door/">count the number of chickens in the chicken coop</a>. It’s likely that AI Tasks can now help you easily do this in Home Assistant, without the need for complex scripts, extra add-ons, or HACS integrations.</p>
<p>Below is a template entity that counts chickens in a video feed, all via a short and simple set of instructions.</p>

<p>This template sends a snapshot of the camera to the AI, asking it to analyze what is going on. It defines that the output should always be a number, since we want to use that information in Home Assistant. All of this is embedded in a template entity that automatically updates every 5 minutes. An AI Task could also be embedded in an automation, a script, or any other place that can execute actions.</p>

    <img src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09-ai/activity.webp" alt="Activity view in Home Assistant of the doorbell image analyzed by AI Tasks">
    An automation triggers an AI Task to identify what caused motion on a camera.
</div>
<p>Lastly, users can set a default AI Task entity. This allows users to skip picking an entity ID when creating AI automations. It also lets you migrate everything that uses AI Tasks to the latest model with a single click. This also makes it easy to share blueprints that leverage AI Tasks, like this blueprint that analyzes a camera snapshot when motion is detected:</p>
<p><a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.home-assistant.io%2Ft%2Fai-camera-analysis%2F911634' class='my badge' target='_blank'><img src='https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg' /></a></p>
<h2>MCP opens a whole new world</h2>
<p><a href="/integrations/mcp/">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP) is a thin layer allowing LLMs to integrate <em>anything</em>. When the specification was announced, we quickly jumped on it and integrated it into Home Assistant. Effectively, these servers give Home Assistant’s Assist conversation agent access to all sorts of new tools. You could connect MCP servers that give Assist access to the latest news stories, your to-do lists, or a server that catalogues your vinyl collection, allowing you to have richer conversations (<em>“Okay Nabu, which Replacements albums do I have, and which aren’t on my Vinyl-to-Purchase list?”</em>).</p>
<p>On the flip side, you can also <a href="/integrations/mcp_server/">turn Home Assistant into an MCP server</a>, allowing an AI system to access information about your home. For instance, you could create a local AI that’s great at making Home Assistant automations, and it could include all your entity names or available actions. MCP keeps gaining more support, and there are some great cloud and self-hosted solutions available.</p>
<h2>How to pick a model</h2>
<p>There are a lot of models available, it’s hard to know where to start. Luckily, Home Assistant’s resident AI guru <a href="https://github.com/allenporter">@AllenPorter</a> is here to help. He has put together an incredibly useful <a href="https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports">Home LLM Leaderboard</a>. This dataset includes his extensive tests of cloud and local LLM options, and even has tests that give small local LLMs a fighting chance (see <a href="https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-datasets/tree/main/reports#assist-mini">assist-mini</a>).</p>
<p>Currently, the charts show the big cloud players’ most recent models ranking pretty close to each other, while recent local models that use 8GB or more of VRAM are nearly keeping up. In the past, there was a big disparity between most models, but now it’s hard to go wrong.</p>
<p>This is especially helpful as the options for LLMs in Home Assistant have just grown exponentially with the addition of <a href="/integrations/open_router">OpenRouter</a>, a unified interface for LLMs. With OpenRouter, users can access over 400 new models in Home Assistant, and it supports AI Tasks right from day one. We really are spoiled for choice.</p>
<h2>The future is Open, and Open Source</h2>
<p>Home Assistant is open. We believe that you should be in control of your data, and your smart home. All of it. Local LLMs and the way we have architected Home Assistant extends this choice to the AI space, all while maintaining your privacy.</p>
<p>Most crucially, we’ve made all of this open source. We are community-driven and work on this together with our community. The Open Home Foundation has no investors and is not beholden to anyone but our users. Our work is funded through hardware purchases and <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscriptions, allowing us to make all the technology we build free and open.</p>

    <link href="https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/09/03/release-20259/"/>
    <updated>2025-09-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><lite-youtube videoid="4oeQZhxYUNk" videotitle="Home Assistant 2025.9 Release Party"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>Home Assistant 2025.9! 🎉</p>
<p>But before we dive into this release: <em>Did you see we launched a new product?</em> 👀</p>
<p>We’ve introduced the <a href="/connect/zwa-2/">Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2</a>, the ultimate way to connect Z-Wave devices to Home Assistant. You can read all about it in our <a href="/blog/2025/08/13/home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/">announcement blog 📰</a> or re-watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-pUkM6XIuA">product launch live stream on YouTube 📺</a>.</p>
<p>It was a busy month, as we also had two new <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> program partners joining this month as well: <a href="/blog/2025/08/21/airgradient-joins-works-with-home-assistant/">AirGradient</a> and <a href="/blog/2025/09/02/frient-joins-works-with-home-assistant/">Frient</a>! 🎉</p>
<p>While the above was happening this month, as if the project wasn’t already busy enough, we kept on pushing to prepare for this release; and it is an absolute <strong>massive</strong> one! 🤯</p>
<p>This month introduces a new experimental Home dashboard, which aims to become the new default dashboard for Home Assistant in a future release. A first iteration, of which we love to see your feedback and input on. As you know, we develop and iterate in the open. Give it a shot and let us know what you think!</p>
<p>Talking about dashboards, my personal favorite card is definitely the <a href="/dashboards/tile/">tile card</a>; it is just so versatile. And this release brings in a staggering amount of new features for it! Most notably, the ability to add a trend graph to the tile card! 📈</p>
<p>I’m the most excited about the visual changes to the automation editor this release brings: a sidebar. It is a huge and very visible change, that just makes so much sense. This release denotes the start of a whole series of improvements to the automation editor in this, and upcoming releases. As automations make a smart home feel magical, I personally can’t wait to see how this evolves. 🤖</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>Automation editor sidebar</h2>
<p>On <a href="/blog/2025/05/09/roadmap-2025h1/#and-thats-not-all-for-this-year">this year’s Home Assistant roadmap</a>, we have set the goal of making automations easier to create. We have big plans, all based on tons of research, and with this release… we are shipping the first part of all this work, with the intent to gradually add more improvements over multiple releases!</p>
<p>This release tweaks the automation editor user interface experience by introducing a sidebar! If you select an item in your automation, instead of that item expanding, it will open a new sidebar to the right with the settings for that selected item.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showcasing a sidebar in our automation editor." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09/automation-sidebar.png" />
<p>This allows you to keep an overview of your automation on the left side of your screen, while you can tweak its behavior on the right. Of course, we have thought of smaller screens as well. On mobile, instead of the sidebar, a sheet will pop up at the bottom of the screen. This pop-up is also resizable, making it easier than ever to edit an action while reviewing your triggers.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing how on a smaller screen device a sheet is shown from the bottom of the page." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09/automation-bottom-sheet.png" />
<p>Besides the sidebar, we have made tons of other little improvements as well. Tiny layout and styling changes that you will definitely notice as they really help with the overall readability. For example, small lines and borders around grouped elements have been added, making it easier to distinguish between different parts of your automation. Oh! And drag-and-drop support is now available on mobile! 🎉</p>

<h2>Introducing the Home dashboard</h2>
<p>Over the past year, we have focused on dashboards and their capabilities a lot. We’ve looked at a lot of your dashboards you’ve shared on socials, and talked to many of you about how you organize all your smart home devices and services. The goal? Making dashboards faster and easier to create, while still making them very customizable.</p>
<p>With this release, we’re introducing a brand-new <em>Home dashboard</em>. The purpose is simple: to give you easy access to the right information at the right time.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new Home dashboard" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09/home-dashboard.png" />
<p>The dashboard adapts to your Home Assistant experience level: powerful enough for advanced users, yet approachable for newcomers. We’re working to have it earn its name, and hope it will eventually become your new <em>Home</em> page. As always, it’s optional; you can always pick your own dashboard. This is the first iteration, and we’ll continue developing it in the open.</p>
<p>When you first open the Home dashboard, it gives you a quick way to navigate to useful summaries for your light, climate, security, and media devices. You can also browse by areas, getting an overview of all the devices and services associated with that part of your home.</p>
<p>We’re also introducing Favorites. You can pin any entity to the top, whether it’s a light, climate, or a person. We’d love to see what you choose (more on this in the future).</p>
<p>The Home dashboard is not just about quick control. It also brings insights and information about your home. This first release includes weather and energy cards. It’s a simple start, and we have a lot of ideas to explore with you. For example, helping you create your first automation, or show discovered devices.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new Home dashboard viewing the living room area" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09/home-dashboard-area.png" />
<p>For now, the Home dashboard is considered experimental. Configuration options are limited, and it’s guaranteed to evolve. It won’t appear automatically, and if you want to try it you’ll need to add it manually in the <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/lovelace_dashboards/">dashboard settings</a>, by adding a new “Home” dashboard.</p>

<h2>New tile card features</h2>
<p>The <a href="/dashboards/tile/">tile card</a> is the most versatile card we have in our arsenal
of <a href="/dashboards/">cards for our dashboards</a>.</p>
<p>One superpower of the tile card is its “features”, which are small additions where you can add quick interactions to these cards. For example, a slider to control the brightness of a light or buttons for the speed presets of a fan. Features have been extended quite a bit in this release by a dedicated group of community members.</p>
<h3>Trend chart</h3>
<p>This release, an absolute banger is the addition of the trend chart features for tile cards created by <a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a>.</p>
<p>This feature adds a handy quick graph to the tile card, showing the history of a specific entity over time. For this initial version, the time window shown is 24 hours.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing a tile card using the new trend graph feature" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-trend-graph.png" />
<h3>Media player controls</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/timmo001">@timmo001</a>, added tile card features for media player controls and volume! This makes the tile card now a viable alternative to the media player card. Awesome!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing a tile card using the new media player features" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-media-player.png" />
<h3>Bar gauge</h3>
<p>A new tile card feature, made by <a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a>: The bar gauge!</p>
<p>For this initial version, it works with sensors that use a percentage (<code>%</code>) for their unit of measurement.
This makes the card great, for example, for a battery overview dashboard. Nice work!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing a tile card using the new bar gauge feature" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-bar-gauge.png" />
<h3>Fan direction and oscillation controls</h3>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/pcan08">@pcan08</a> we now have a tile card feature to control fan direction and oscillation!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing a tile card using the new fan direction and oscillation features" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-fan.png" />
<h3>Buttons</h3>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/dhoeben">@dhoeben</a> we now have a tile card feature for buttons! He added these buttons for automation, script, and button entities. The text can be changed to display standard button text or custom text.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing a tile card using the new button feature" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-button.png" />
<h3>Valve open/close and position controls</h3>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/timmo001">@timmo001</a> we now have a tile card feature to control the open/close and the position of valves.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing a tile card using the new open/close and valve position features" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-valve.png" />
<h3>Setting the date</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/timmo001">@timmo001</a> continued and also added a new tile card feature to support date and datetime entities (including the input datetime helpers). It allows you to add a feature that allows for setting a date.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing a tile card using the new date feature" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09/tile-features-date.png" />

</ul>
<h3>Integration quality scale achievements</h3>
<p>One thing we are incredibly proud of in Home Assistant is our
<a href="/docs/quality_scale/">integration quality scale</a>. This scale helps us and our contributors to ensure
integrations are of high quality, maintainable, and provide the best possible
user experience.</p>
<p>This release, we celebrate several <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have improved
their quality scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>2 integrations reached platinum</strong> 🏆</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/nut">Network UPS Tools (NUT)</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tdfountain">@tdfountain</a></li>
<li><a href="/integrations/uptime_kuma">Uptime Kuma</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tr4nt0r">@tr4nt0r</a></li>

</ul>
<p>This is a huge achievement for these integrations and their maintainers. The
effort and dedication required to reach these quality levels is significant,
as it involves extensive testing, documentation, error handling, and often
complete rewrites of parts of the integration.</p>
<p>A big thank you to all the contributors involved! 👏</p>
<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>
<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.</p>
<p>The following integration is now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/bayesian">Bayesian</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/HarvsG">@HarvsG</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> is no longer available as
of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uonet+ Vulcan</strong> has been removed. Vulcan has changed their API and their
policies forbid using the API from unofficial software.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other noteworthy changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on feature requests from the community, all modern <a href="/integrations/template/">template entity</a> syntax now supports setting a default entity ID directly in YAML. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a> for implementing that!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a> also added support for two new entity types to the template integration. You can now create your own templated <a href="/integrations/template#event">event entities</a> and <a href="/integrations/template#update">update entities</a>. Awesome!</li>
<li>Home Assistant now supports <code>m³/min</code> as a volume flow rate unit. Nice addition <a href="https://github.com/fetzerch">@fetzerch</a>!</li>
<li>Our voice guy <a href="https://github.com/synesthesiam">@synesthesiam</a> has been busy with some great QoL improvements this release as well.
<ul>
<li>The intent handling for the default agent (non-LLM) now supports fuzzy matching. The technique ensures voice pipelines recognize many more sentences. This improvement is available for English only, while we are looking for ways to extend this to other languages.</li>
<li>We now have built-in intents to control the volume of (active) media players! Like the song? Just ask Home Assistant to turn it up a notch!</li>
<li>After all that dancing, you might have gotten a little warm. Hence in this release, we now also have intents to control fan speeds. Nice!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Analog clock</h3>
<p>In <a href="/blog/2025/04/02/release-20254/#time-for-a-new-card!">Home Assistant 2025.4, we introduced the clock card</a>, which provides a digital clock display for your dashboards.</p>
<p>For this release, <a href="https://github.com/timmo001">@timmo001</a> made this card more feature-rich by adding support for displaying the clock in a customizable analog clock style. Nice!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing multiple analog clocks in different sizes and styles" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-09/analog-clock.png" />
<h3>Storage insights</h3>
<p>Disk almost full? You might wonder where your storage space has gone…</p>

    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/09/02/frient-joins-works-with-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-09-frient/art.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Frient joins Works with Home Assistant">
<p>We’re making new frients this week, and they’re bringing an extensive line of Zigbee devices to our <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works With Home Assistant program</a>. Each device is tested by our team, ensuring they provide the best experience possible for Home Assistant. <a href="https://www.frient.com/">Frient</a> is widely available across Europe, and are well-known for their sleek, unobtrusive designs that its customers love for their high Home Approval Factor.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Our newest frient</h2>
<p>Based in Denmark, the frient brand was developed by Onics, (formerly Develco Products), and they have years of experience with Zigbee devices. Frient is bringing its proven technology to the Works With Home Assistant program, as well as their Danish design that easily blends into almost any home.</p>
<p>Recent Works With partners have brought Z-Wave, Matter, and even Bluetooth devices to Home Assistant, but it’s been <em>a couple of years</em> 😅 since Zigbee-specific devices have joined the program. Zigbee is one of the most popular open protocols that is used with Home Assistant, with hundreds of thousands of users making use of it today. It’s a proven technology that connects directly to Home Assistant, no cloud or Wi-Fi connection required. Zigbee is a mesh protocol, where some devices act as repeaters, strengthening the network as more are added. It was built from the ground up to power the smart home, and has been optimized to give devices really long (sometimes multi-year) battery life.</p>
<div class="alert">
<p>"Joining the Works With Home Assistant program is a proud milestone for frient. It reflects our strong commitment to open, user-centric smart home experiences and ensures that our products seamlessly integrate with one of the most trusted platforms in the market. For Home Assistant users, it means more choice and flexibility — and for frient, it strengthens our position as a key player in the connected smart home space."</p>
<em style="text-align: right; display: block;">- Martin Langballe, International Business Development Manager at frient</em>
</div>
<p>All you need to get started with Zigbee in Home Assistant is a Zigbee adapter or ‘stick’, such as the <a href="/connectzbt1/">Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1</a> (wow, we released this in 2022, I wonder when we’re finally going to build a successor? 😉). By plugging the adapter into a USB port on your Home Assistant system, it should then discover the device and add the <a href="/integrations/frient/">ZHA integration</a>. After that is set up, you can start adding devices to your Zigbee network.  We’ve even added in a cool <a href="/blog/2025/06/11/release-20256/#making-sense-of-bluetooth">new visualization</a> so that you can see how your Zigbee devices interact with each other.</p>
<p>ZHA is built with the support of the Open Home Foundation, and it even has a full-time developer (<a href="https://github.com/puddly">@puddly</a>) dedicated to improving it and helping certify new Works With partner devices. Your support makes this possible, whether through a Home Assistant Cloud subscription or by purchasing official hardware.</p>
<h2>Devices</h2>
<p class="img">

When your energy company won’t provide your raw usage data, there’s always another way 😉
</p>
<p>In case you didn’t know, Works With Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box with Home Assistant. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works With Home Assistant is operated by the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work.</p>
<p>Our team has worked extensively with frient to ensure that the following items work seamlessly with Home Assistant.</p>

<p>This is a big portion of frient’s product line, and provides energy monitoring, device control, safety, and security sensors. The frient IO Module is the first certified Zigbee module that can be used to turn low-voltage dumb devices like electric blinds or garage doors into devices that can be controlled by Home Assistant.</p>
<p>There are some great devices here for building a more sustainable smart home. The Electricity Meter Interface 2 LED allows you to get the data off your energy meter and record it into Home Assistant. Another win for sustainability is their use of AA and AAA batteries wherever practical, meaning you can use rechargeables instead of constantly buying and recycling coin cells.</p>
<p>I also selfishly love to see some great UK-specific devices being brought into the program with the frient Smart Siren having both UK and EU versions.</p>
<h2>Best frients forever</h2>
<p>It’s great to see Zigbee get some high-quality certified Works With Home Assistant devices after a multi-year wait. Frient has put a good deal of work into this launch and are big fans of our work and the community. There are more exciting Zigbee developments to come, so stay tuned!</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under “Works With Home Assistant” does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></p>
<p>A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function perfectly well but be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Ok, so what’s the point of the Works With program?</strong></p>
<p>A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have full functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud, and will continue to do so long-term.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></p>
<p>A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard HA Green Hub with the ZBT-1 and with the ZHA integration. We haven’t tested these devices with Zigbee2MQTT, so we would recommend checking their <a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=Frient">device compatibility documentation</a>. If you have another hub, Zigbee adapter, or integration, that’s not a problem, but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be adding more frient devices to the program?</strong></p>
<p>A: Why not! We’re thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at frient to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here.</p>

    <updated>2025-08-21T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/08/21/airgradient-joins-works-with-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-airgradient/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="AirGradient joins Works with Home Assistant">
<p>We’re excited to announce that <a href="https://www.airgradient.com/">AirGradient</a> is the latest manufacturer to join the fast-growing <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works With Home Assistant</a> program! They bring their air quality monitors to the program, with both indoor and outdoor models.</p>
<p>AirGradient is the first partner in the program focused on building advanced indoor and outdoor air quality monitors. They are also well known within our community for their powerful tech, and for their focus on open source and dedication to local air quality projects around the world.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>A breath of fresh air</h2>
<p>AirGradient is the first partner to join that operates out of Thailand, and they initially started making their air monitors to help their local community. They actively support air quality improvement projects both in Thailand itself, but also globally. AirGradient donates monitors and has partnered with a variety of different organisations and NGOs, including <a href="https://www.airgradient.com/blog/open-source-to-change-the-world/">UNICEF</a>. These monitors are often placed in schools, helping young people to better understand and work to protect their air quality.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-08-airgradient/outdoors.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="An Open Air Monitor mounted outdoors in Vietnam">An Open Air Monitor in Vietnam</p>
<p>Community is central to our work with AirGradient. Their hardware and software are open source, just like our own. Plus, they’ve taken an active role in integrating into Home Assistant, bringing <a href="/integrations/airgradient/">their local Wi-Fi integration</a> up to not just the gold, but the platinum tier on our <a href="/docs/quality_scale/">integration quality scale.</a> Like all of our <em>Works With</em> partners, the devices work completely locally with no need for a cloud connection. What’s more, they really embrace the DIY aspect of the smart home, with their devices available fully assembled or as a build-it-yourself kit!</p>
<p>AirGradient’s open approach even extends to the data collected by their community of users. Whilst completely optional, users can share their air quality readings with the world (which they <a href="https://www.airgradient.com/map/?zoom=1&amp;lat=49.2125578&amp;long=16.62662018&amp;org=ag&amp;meas=rco2">visualize into an amazing map</a>). This helpful air quality map grows every time a user opts to share their data, and is a fantastic open resource for climate researchers, students, or anyone concerned about air quality in their local area. If your area is a blank spot on this map, that is all the more reason to buy an AirGradient outdoor monitor.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-airgradient/visual-map.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="An online AirGradient air quality map">
<p>Each kit comes with a screwdriver and is designed for easy repair. Broken sensor? Swap it out. Firmware update needed? Flash it yourself. Sustainability is one of the core guiding principles of the Open Home Foundation, and we love that repairability is built in. AirGradient also donates at least 1% of annual sales to non-profits and community direct donations. In fact, they asked us to include in this blog an open invitation to our community: If you have a local project that you think would benefit from open source air quality monitors, get in touch through <a href="https://www.airgradient.com/support/">this link</a>.</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>"We're excited to join the Works With Home Assistant program because it aligns perfectly with our open-source philosophy. Home Assistant represents the same values we believe in - local control, privacy, and community-driven innovation. Together, we're proving that open systems don't just work better for users, they create better outcomes for the planet."</p>
<em style="text-align: right; display: block;">- Achim Haug, Founder and CEO of AirGradient</em>
</div>
<h2>Certified Devices</h2>
<p>In case you’re new to <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works With Home Assistant</a>, unlike some certification programs, it’s not just a badge. We rigorously test items in-house and provide feedback to the manufacturers to ensure that products work easily out of the box and provide a seamless experience. The Works With program is operated by the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a> and funded by the support of <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> Subscribers.</p>
<p>AirGradient has certified the following devices with us:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.airgradient.com/indoor/">AirGradient One - Indoor Air Quality Monitor</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.airgradient.com/outdoor/">AirGradient Open Air - Outdoor Air Quality Monitor</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-08-airgradient/kitchen-counter.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="An AirGradient One sitting on a kitchen counter">Finally, a metric to show precisely how badly you burned your dinner</p>
<p>When we talk about sustainability in relation to the smart home, it’s easy to focus on energy management and reducing our carbon impact. However, with AirGradient, you can deep dive into the impacts of the release of CO2 and other air pollutants, better understanding what you, your family, and friends breathe in every day. With an in-house science team of atmospheric chemists and public health experts, they ensure that the monitors are accurate and each of the fully assembled monitors are tested in a dedicated test chamber.</p>
<p>Whether you want to see if your new furniture is putting dangerous VOCs into the air, or if a smelly candle is going to aggravate any allergies, the use cases are endless. The AirGradient One also has a built-in display with both detailed data and a set of LEDs to show general air quality at a glance. Both devices measure carbon dioxide, VOCs, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, temperature, and humidity. AirGradient also provides helpful documentation on their website that helps you understand these measurements and the impact they can have on your household.</p>
<p>These devices can not only give you in-depth information about the air in and out of your home, but they can also unlock powerful automations. We often see these devices paired with door or window open/close sensors, air purifiers, dehumidifiers, or air conditioners to reduce particulates in the home from pets or carpets.</p>
<h2>Clearing the air</h2>
<p>We’re so excited to be partnered with AirGradient. Their mission is important, and their open and sustainable approach is precisely what we love to see. Partnerships like this are only possible with the support of <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers. Many of us at the Open Home Foundation have picked up AirGradient monitors and are sharing our air quality data today, and we’d love for you to join us on the map!</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under Works With Home Assistant, does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></p>
<p>A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program.

<p><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></p>
<p>A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard HA Green Hub with the local AirGradient integration and a Wi-Fi network. HA will automatically discover them after they join your network (following the device’s instructions to add it to the WiFi). If you have another setup, that’s not a problem, but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be adding more AirGradient devices to the program?</strong></p>
<p>A: Why not! We’re thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at AirGradient to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here.</p>

<h2>We love open standards</h2>
<p>Open standards let you connect devices directly to Home Assistant for local, private control, and keep working for years, even if the manufacturer disappears. To make connecting these standards as seamless as possible, we like to build our own hardware.</p>
<p>In late 2022, we launched <a href="/connectzbt1/">Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1</a> (formerly SkyConnect), a USB adapter for Zigbee and Thread. It made both protocols much easier to get started with, and sales helped fund Home Assistant development. We knew the next standard to tackle was Z-Wave, and after another couple of hardware launches (<a href="/green">Home Assistant Green</a> and <a href="/voice-pe/">Voice Preview Edition</a>), we finally had the time to do it right.</p>
<h3>Why Z-Wave?</h3>
<p>If you’re new to Z-Wave, its key advantage over other open standards is its use of sub-GHz radio waves, which are better at getting through thick walls and reaching across large households. While Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Thread all compete for the same crowded airspace (2.4 GHz), Z-Wave operates in its own much quieter spectrum (865-926 MHz). Z-Wave is great for range, but its new <a href="https://z-wavealliance.org/what-is-z-wave-long-range-how-does-it-differ-from-z-wave/">Z-Wave Long Range variant</a> builds even further on this… <em>but more on that later</em>.</p>
<p>As the standard is over two decades old, it’s had a lot of time to iron out any kinks, but it also has over 4,500 certified devices to choose from. Our opt-in stats show over 130,000 Home Assistant households are using Z-Wave today. Several <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> partners are building amazing Z-Wave products, including <a href="/integrations/zooz/">Zooz</a>, <a href="/integrations/shelly_zwave/">Shelly</a>, <a href="/integrations/ultraloq/">Ultraloq</a>, <a href="/integrations/leviton_z_wave/">Leviton</a>, and <a href="/integrations/homeseer/">Homeseer</a>. You can also go to any local marketplace and pick up any working Z-Wave smart device, no matter how old, and it will still connect with Home Assistant!</p>
<h2>Connect ZWA-2 in-depth</h2>
<p>We’ve learned a lot about hardware since the launch of Connect ZBT-1, and we also knew we could breathe some new life into Z-Wave on Home Assistant. Making this device was the start of us leveling up the Connect platform and establishing our <strong>second generation</strong>, which is all about building the most performant and open design. That is why we jumped straight to <em>two</em> for this Connect ZWA-2!</p>
<h3>Go big or go home</h3>
<p>To be the most performant, we knew we had to ditch the “stick” form factor. It was never ideal, as USB ports can output a lot of interference. We even shipped a USB extender with Connect ZBT-1, and urged people to use it, as it kept the device away from any noisy components. Instead of building a stick we built an <em>adapter</em>, which includes an optimized standalone antenna and base that connects to your Home Assistant system with a USB cable.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/precisely-engineered.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Comparison of the Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 antenna to other Z-Wave antennas, showing the size difference">
<p>We’re not compensating for anything; a big antenna does make a big difference. For starters, you need an antenna that’s the right size for your wavelength. As Z-Wave is in the sub-GHz, this means the antenna has to be longer than your average Wi-Fi antenna (about 33 cm or a foot is the sweet spot).</p>
<p>You need to optimize not just the antenna, but also the base of the device (also known as the <em>ground plane</em>). Our hardware experts really went deep into all the physics involved, and the results speak for themselves. Basically, by choosing the right ratio of antenna to base, the two work in harmony to maximize the range and reliability of the signal.</p>
<p>While some Z-Wave adapters may claim they can hit the maximum transmit levels with their postage-stamp-sized antennas, that can sometimes come with a lot of interference. We’ve engineered away that problem. Connect ZWA-2 can speak loudly and clearly 🗣️, and what’s even more important, it’s a great listener 👂.</p>
<h3>Positioning is everything</h3>
<p>Having a big optimized antenna is great, but placement is almost as important. Its sturdy base and good-sized USB cable allow it to be placed in the right spot. No more will you have a dangling dongle hidden behind a server cabinet. We even put in an accelerometer to ensure people position the antenna upright, this ensures devices are in the sweet spot of the antenna. If you place it on its side, it will subtly blink the status light at the top.</p>
<h3>All the Z-Wave</h3>
<p>Inside Connect ZWA-2, we include the latest Z-Wave 800 chip, which supports all Z-Wave devices. We’re also Z-Wave certified, giving you that extra peace of mind. This, combined with Home Assistant’s industry-leading Z-Wave software, means Z-Wave has never been this good. On your certified smart devices, you might see Security 2 (S2), SmartStart, Z-Wave Plus, or Z-Wave Plus V2 — don’t worry, we support it all. One new feature we support that is getting people very excited is Z-Wave Long Range👇.</p>
<h3>Go long</h3>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/supports-all-devices.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Isometric view of the Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 revealing the internal PCB featuring the Z-Wave 800 chipset">
<p>Combining Z-Wave’s natural abilities with an optimized antenna has given us some impressive range, but we took it a few steps further. We added Z-Wave Long Range to Connect ZWA-2, which might be one of the most substantial updates to Z-Wave yet.</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p><strong>Z-Wave Long Range</strong><br> Long Range doesn’t use mesh, where devices relay messages through each other to reach the hub. Instead, each device talks straight to your hub, which brings some benefits. It runs on the same frequency as regular Z-Wave but at a higher power, and uses new technology that lets it reach farther, handle more devices, respond faster, and save battery. Right now, it is only available in North America and Europe, and the selection of compatible devices is still growing. This is just scratching the surface; for more on this impressive tech, read a <a href="https://z-wavealliance.org/what-is-z-wave-long-range-how-does-it-differ-from-z-wave/" target="_blank">full breakdown</a> from our friends at the Z-Wave Alliance.</p>
</div>
<p>Z-Wave Long Range is different enough that it needs its own separate network. Connect ZWA-2 can run both Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long Range <strong>at the same time</strong>. When you add a Long Range capable device to Home Assistant, the setup wizard lets you choose which network to use. This way, you get the best of both worlds: a strong mesh network for your older devices, and the reach of Long Range for the newest devices that include support.</p>
<h3>How long?</h3>
<p class="img">
<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/zwa-2-prototype-testing.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Dominic with our stick prototype alongside DrZWave with the controller reference design. Uwe is on the other bridge, 0.7 miles away">
See that bridge in the background? Our prototype connected to a device all the way over there.
</p>
<p>People are getting some impressive results with ZWA-2:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You might have seen our range testing <a href="/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead/#range-testing-our-z-wave-stick-prototype">in a previous blog</a>. Since then, we’ve optimized the design and achieved a line-of-sight range of 1.5 kilometers (0.9 miles) 🤯. This was under less than ideal circumstances (raining and within a car), and we think we could go even further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The certifying engineer said it was “the best range she had ever seen”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another test had it communicating via Z-Wave Long Range through several floors of concrete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testers with outdoor lights and internal brick walls have commented on how this is the first time they’ve had reliable connections with devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interesting Long Range use cases have included smart mailboxes that notify you when <em>you’ve got mail</em>, or contact sensors on garden gates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every home and setup is different, so we can’t definitively say how far your devices will span. What we can say is that nothing else we’ve tested comes close to what Connect ZWA-2 can do.</p>
<h3>Built for Home Assistant</h3>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/plug-and-play.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 connected to a Home Assistant Green">
<p>Whenever we build new hardware, we step up our software development to match. You may have noticed a lot of love going into Z-Wave for Home Assistant. All Z-Wave users benefit from this, and when people buy Connect ZWA-2, they’re helping fund this development.</p>
<p>Connect ZWA-2 is built for Home Assistant, and because of this, it’s super easy to get started with. We’ve built Connect ZWA-2 to support every region, no matter where you buy it from. When you plug in Connect ZWA-2, it automatically detects and sets your region using the location configured in your Home Assistant system.</p>
<p>We’ve built handy wizards to help you set up your first Z-Wave network and to guide you in setting up new devices. A wizard also helps you quickly migrate from most Z-Wave adapters to Connect ZWA-2 in a couple of clicks. We also have the ability to update the firmware of Connect ZWA-2 right from Home Assistant, and update the firmware over-the-air (OTA) of Z-Wave devices in a single click.</p>
<h3>ESP inside</h3>
<p class="img">
<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/zwa-2-pcb.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Front and back of the PCB outside the shell of the Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2">
I’ll save you the time opening it up; here is the front and back of the PCB.
</p>
<p>As always, we’ve made Connect ZWA-2 easy to open. Just pop out the rubber feet and remove the four Phillips screws, with no glue or clips to get in the way. If you do open it up, you’ll see a familiar sight, an ESP32-S3. We’re using it as a USB controller, and it’s not running ESPHome. Yes, it does have a “Wi-Fi antenna”, but we’re not using it. We’ve provided a lot of easily accessible pins/pads, open source firmware files, unlocked bootloader, and good documentation, so feel free to tinker. We’ll also provide all the files to allow you to 3D-print the outer casing.</p>
<h3>Blending into the home</h3>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-home-assistant-connect-zwa-2/in-the-home.webp' alt="Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2 sitting on a shelf next to a plant and some books">
<p>It’s no small feat to make something 33 cm (1 ft) long look so subtle in the home. We’ve modeled its design after a candle and even used the top of the antenna as a status indicator. Its quality injection-molded exterior has a premium feel and shares many design cues from our sleek-looking Voice Preview Edition.</p>
<h2>Join the smart home range revolution</h2>
<p>Last year, we proclaimed in a blog that “<a href="/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead/">Z-Wave is not dead</a>”, and this hardware is a testament to that belief. Even with new technologies being released every week, there’s still room to innovate with something tried and tested. We will always support technology that respects your privacy, allows you to control your devices without the cloud, all while keeping the things you already have in your home running for years to come.</p>
<p>After 1600 words on a Z-Wave adapter, we’re obviously very proud of what we’ve built and excited to see what amazing things people will do with this labor of love. So, whether you’re a Z-Wave veteran or just interested in cool new technology, take a look at <a href="/connect/zwa-2/">Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2</a> today.</p>

<p>Home Assistant 2025.8! 🎉</p>
<p>In most parts of the world, summer mode is in full effect! ☀️ Many at the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a> and many of our contributors are enjoying a well-deserved break from work and open source. I hope that you are maybe enjoying a well-deserved break as well! 🏖️</p>
<p>Summer breaks or not, we are currently very busy with our next <strong>product launch</strong>! In case you have missed it, this upcoming Wednesday, August 13 (12:00 PM PT, 3:00 PM ET, 21:00 CEST), we will have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-pUkM6XIuA">an extra live stream to announce the next big thing</a> in the Home Assistant Connect series! Be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-pUkM6XIuA">head over to YouTube to hit the reminder button</a> so you don’t miss it! <strong>Z-Wave is not dead!</strong> 🌊</p>
<p>Alright, on to the release! We keep moving during summer and are excited to bring you the August release of Home Assistant!</p>
<p>Let’s start with my personal favorite of this release: The improved experience when viewing a group, for example, a group helper with lights. 💡 When viewing such a group entity, you can now control the individual members of that group directly in that dialog. Super useful! I’m pretty sure that will be used a lot in our house.</p>
<p>But as the release title suggests, this release brings in an important foundation for new AI opportunities in Home Assistant: <strong>AI Tasks</strong>.
Think of it as a way to delegate tasks to AI and get back the result of that task in a structured way so it can be used. Sounds vague?
Dive into the release notes below!</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>AI in Home Assistant in 2025</h2>
<p>We introduced our first AI integration in Home Assistant 2023.2 where users could let OpenAI handle their interactions with Home Assistant Voice. Since that time, AI has seen a big surge in popularity within the Home Assistant community for <em>all kinds</em> of use cases. Funny notifications when the laundry is done, analyzing what’s happening on a camera or skipping the song when AI determines <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/1at0re0/out_of_my_42_automations_this_is_my_best_one_by/">it’s a country song</a> 😅.</p>
<p>Though AI gets many people excited, there are still people who would prefer not to have this technology in their smart homes. We want to accommodate everyone’s choices, whether that’s to use AI or not. These features won’t appear unless you set up an AI integration and configure some specific settings.</p>
<p>Last year, we sat down to determine how all these use cases, all complicated to achieve, could be made accessible to everyone. The first thing that came out of this was <a href="/blog/2025/07/02/release-20257/#integration-sub-entries">integration sub-entries</a>, which we shipped in the last release. It allows users to configure their Ollama server or API key for OpenAI <em>once</em>, and then create many different agents using different models or configuration underneath. In this release we’re building two new things you can optionally enable via these new sub-entries for AI integrations: <em>AI tasks</em> and <em>Suggest with AI</em>. We’re also introducing a new integration, OpenRouter, which is a unified LLM interface giving access to over 400 extra LLM models.</p>
<p>Big thanks to our AI community contributors: <a href="https://github.com/AllenPorter">@AllenPorter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/shulyaka">@shulyaka</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tronikos">@tronikos</a>, <a href="https://github.com/IvanLH">@IvanLH</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">@joostlek</a>!</p>
<h3>Streaming Text-to-Speech for Home Assistant Cloud</h3>
<p>When you use Home Assistant Voice to talk to an AI, you can do a lot more than just control your home. LLMs can summarize the state of your home, and when using LLMs from Google and OpenAI, they can search the web to answer your questions with up-to-date information. This is great, but these answers can become quite long. Previously, voice responses wouldn’t begin until the AI had finished generating the entire answer, so longer replies meant a longer wait before anything was read aloud.</p>
<p>When a user waits for Home Assistant Voice to respond, long wait times really hurt the experience. We have overhauled Home Assistant so our Text-to-Speech system can start generating the response audio before the full response is done generating. Last release we launched this for <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/create-link/?redirect=supervisor_addon&amp;addon=core_piper">Piper</a>, our local Text-to-Speech system. In this release we’re making this available to the voices included in <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com">Home Assistant Cloud</a> – the best way of supporting the Home Assistant project.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="AZ0-8wW0UL4" videotitle="Streaming Text-to-Speech with Home Assistant Cloud by Nabu Casa"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>This improvement will especially benefit users who use local AI (which can be slow in generating responses) or users who play long announcements on their speakers.</p>
<h3>Integrate AI into your workflow using AI Task</h3>
<p>AI Task is a new integration that allows you to generate data using AI. After you add the “AI Task” sub-entry in your AI of choice, the entity will appear in the integration. This allows you to attach files or cameras and ask it what is happening. The output can either be given in text or formatted in a data structure of your choice. This is all accessible from the new <code>ai_task.generate_data</code> action, which can be embedded in automations, scripts, and template entities.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a template entity that updates every five minutes and counts the number of chickens in the coop. <a href="https://houndhillhomestead.com/google-gemini-powered-goose-coop-door/">Example inspired by this blog post.</a></p>

<p>To help get started with AI task, we’ve prepared a blueprint to analyze camera footage:</p>
<p><a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.home-assistant.io%2Ft%2Fai-camera-analysis%2F911634' class='my badge' target='_blank'><img src='https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg' /></a></p>
<h3>Work faster with Suggest with AI buttons</h3>
<p>The AI Task integration has one extra feature under its belt: default entities. You can go to <a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/general' class='my' target='_blank'><strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong></a> and configure what AI Task entity you want to use as the default. With a default set, you no longer have to specify an entity when generating data, making it easier to share blueprints.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the generic setting where you can set the default AI task entity to use" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-08/ai-suggestions.png" />
<p>Setting a default also does more: When a default is configured, and only then, a new type of button will start showing up in different places in Home Assistant:</p>
<center>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Image of the new Suggest with AI button which you can find in Home Assistant now" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-08/suggest-with-ai.png" />
</center>
<p>This button is not visible by default and will only appear if you enable it in the “AI suggestions” settings. For this release, the button has been added to the save dialog for automations and scripts. It helps users come up with a name, description, category, and label, while taking into account your current labels and other automation/script names. Keep in mind that generating this text sends the full contents of the automation or script, along with the names of your other automations/scripts and labels, to the LLM. So, this may be a task you will want to relegate to your shiny new local LLM.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new AI suggestions button in the save automation dialog and the suggestions it made for this automation" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-08/save-automation.png" />
<h2>Area dashboard improvements</h2>
<p>We’ve added a small improvement to the areas dashboard based on your feedback. You can now choose to show the first camera in an area, or its image or icon, in the area dashboard editor.
It’s a simple way to make certain area cards stand out a bit more—especially handy if you want quicker visual access to specific spaces.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screen recording showing the area dashboard editor with options to display camera feeds, images, or icons in area cards" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-08/area-dashboard-settings.gif" />

<h3>Integration quality scale achievements</h3>
<p>One thing we are incredibly proud of in Home Assistant is our
<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/quality_scale/">integration quality scale</a>. This scale helps us and our contributors to ensure
integrations are of high quality, maintainable, and provide the best possible
user experience.</p>
<p>This release, we celebrate several <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have improved

<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>
<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.</p>
<p>The following integration is now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/datadog">Datadog</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/avedor">@avedor</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other noteworthy changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home Assistant’s interface has received a refresh for better accessibility! The primary color and button colors have been updated to meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance">WCAG AA accessibility standards</a>, improving contrast and readability throughout the interface. All buttons have been redesigned with distinct styles, sizes, and visual priority variants, making it much easier to distinguish between primary, secondary, and less prominent actions. This marks the beginning of a broader effort to update other UI components for improved accessibility and consistency across Home Assistant.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mib1185">@mib1185</a> added a new device class for <strong>absolute humidity</strong> with support for both sensor and number <span class='terminology'>entities<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant. Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other entities. An entity is usually part of a device or a service.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/entities_domains/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>. Nice!</li>
<li>Group management was improved by <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a>, who added the ability to reorder members within a group, making it easier to organize your device groups exactly how you want them. Thanks!</li>
<li>System diagnostics was extended by <a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a> with the addition of a device analytics dump download feature. Awesome!</li>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/history_stats">History Stats</a> <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> now includes a preview in the options flow, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>. This makes it easier to configure your history statistics.</li>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/template">Template</a> <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> received a massive update from <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a>! Here’s what’s new:
<ul>
<li>Trigger-based numeric sensors can now be set to unknown state</li>
<li>The cover, fan, light, lock, and vacuum platforms are now supported in the UI</li>
<li>Availability templates are now supported in the UI for all available platforms</li>
<li>Preview entity has been added to the UI for alarm control panel and select platforms</li>
<li>Template locks now support the opening state</li>
<li>The alarm control panel, fan, light, lock, switch, and vacuum platforms now support all optimistic YAML modes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Control individual members of a group</h3>
<p><a href="/integrations/group">Groups</a> are a great way to control multiple <span class='terminology'>entities<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant. Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other entities. An entity is usually part of a device or a service.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/entities_domains/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>
at once, but sometimes you want to control individual members of a group.</p>
<p>So, for this release, <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a> improved the entity information dialog to show the individual members of a light and cover group, allowing you to control them directly from that dialog. Super useful!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the control of the individual group members when viewing a group helper entity in Home Assistant" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-08/group-control-more-info.png" />
<h3>Weekdays in time trigger</h3>
<p>The <a href="/docs/automation/trigger/#time-trigger">time trigger</a> is already very
useful, but <a href="https://github.com/hmmbob">@hmmbob</a> had <a href="https://github.com/orgs/home-assistant/discussions/26">a feature request</a> that could improve it even more.</p>
<p>He suggested adding the ability to specify weekdays in the time trigger,
allowing users to create automations that only trigger at a specific time
on specific days of the week.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new weekday option when using the time trigger" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-08/time-trigger-weekday.png" />
<p>This feature has been implemented in this release, allowing you to specify
the weekdays in the time trigger. This is especially useful for automations
that need to run on specific days, such as weekdays or weekends.</p>
<h3>Energy flow on your energy dashboard</h3>
<p>The Home Assistant energy dashboard is great, but as of this release it’s even a little better!</p>
<p>Based on the <a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze/ha-sankey-chart">Sankey Chart custom card</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a> added a new
energy flow visualization for the energy dashboard, which shows exactly where
your energy is coming from and where it is going to.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new energy flow on the Home Assistant energy dashboard" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-08/energy-dashboard-energy-flow.png" />
<p>Really cool addition to the energy dashboard <a href="https://github.com/MindFreeze">@MindFreeze</a>!</p>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.8 in August.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release once a week, aiming for Friday.</p>

<p>Support for UniFi Protect installations running on versions below 6.0.0 has been removed.</p>
<p>This change is necessary as we are migrating the Home Assistant integration to use the new UniFi Protect Public API, which is only available in current versions.</p>
<p>If you are running an older version of UniFi Protect, you will need to upgrade to at least version 6.0.0 in order to continue using this integration.</p>
<p>You can read more about the 6.0 release in Ubiquiti’s official blog post:
🔗 <a href="https://blog.ui.com/article/introducing-protect-6-0">Introducing Protect 6.0</a></p>
<p>Note on future updates:
The Public API is still under active development and may change over time. As we continue to migrate more features of the integration to use the Public API, it is likely that the minimum required version of UniFi Protect will increase further in upcoming Home Assistant releases. We will make these changes step by step as the API evolves and new capabilities become available.</p>
<p><strong>What do I need to do?</strong></p>
<p>Upgrade your UniFi Protect installation to version 6.0.0 or later.</p>
<p>Be prepared for possible further minimum version increases in the future.</p>
<p>If you are already using version 6.0.0 or newer, and the user in use has sufficient permissions, the integration will attempt to automatically create a new API key. If this succeeds, no further action is required. If it fails, a reauthentication will be triggered, requiring you to re-enter your password and provide your API key manually.</p>

    <updated>2025-07-29T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/07/29/shelly-joins-works-with-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-07-shelly/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Shelly joins Works with Home Assistant">
<p>We’re excited to welcome <a href="https://www.shelly.com/">Shelly</a> to the <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> program! Shelly is very well-established in both our ecosystem and the smart home world, so it’s great to formally certify a selection of their Z-Wave devices.</p>
<p>Their retrofit smart switches and relays are amazing for turning all sorts of <em>dumb</em> devices, like light fixtures or ceiling fans, into devices you can easily control in <em>smart</em> new ways. Also, being Works with certified means they have been thoroughly tested, ensuring they give the best possible experience with Home Assistant.</p>
<p>The variety of complex settings and functionality, like energy monitoring, makes them popular with our community doing advanced smart retrofits, like connecting an old garage door or motorized shutters. These are perfect for keeping non-smart devices out of the landfill and working for years to come.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>From A to Z-Wave</h2>
<p>Shelly, originally launched in Bulgaria in 2017, has been a mainstay in our community for some years. They became known initially for their WiFi smart switches and relays that could be easily used locally, but now offer a wide range of smart devices and ways to connect them. For this first round of Works with Home Assistant certified products, the focus is firmly on the <a href="/integrations/zwave_js/">Z-Wave</a> lines.</p>
<p> If you’re not familiar with Z-Wave, it’s a well-established low-powered wireless technology designed with the smart home in mind. It uses an entirely different bit of radio spectrum than WiFi, meaning it has less chance of experiencing interference. This spectrum makes it better at getting through thick walls and communicating over longer distances — with the recent <a href="https://z-wavealliance.org/what-is-z-wave-long-range-how-does-it-differ-from-z-wave/">Long Range</a> iteration of the standard, they can <a href="/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead/#range-testing-our-z-wave-stick-prototype">communicate even further</a>.</p>
<p>Given our focus on local control, items that work on Z-Wave are ideal if you want to avoid the cloud. Home Assistant will act as your Z-Wave controller using the <a href="https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-zwave-js-ui">Z-Wave JS add-on</a> (another awesome Open Home Foundation project). So, all you need is a Z-Wave adapter to use alongside these devices. <em>If you haven’t purchased one yet, you might want to wait before hitting that buy button</em> 😉.</p>
<p>Shelly shares our focus on interoperability, with items using a variety of protocols, while being available worldwide. These items are also super helpful for the energy-conscious. They have low power consumption, power metering, and can easily blend in with your current home decor, as they sit in the wall behind your existing switches.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-07-shelly/pm-mini.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Shelly Wave PM Mini in hand showing small size">Mini? This thing is microscopic!</p>
<h2>Getting Involved</h2>
<p>We’ve been lucky enough to meet the Shelly team on several occasions, and they were kind enough to showcase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?t=6897s">how the Las Vegas Mob Museum uses Shelly and Home Assistant</a> during our annual ‘State of the Open Home’ event. In May, they went one step further and hosted one of our <a href="/blog/2025/06/24/community-day-2025-wrap-up/">Community Days</a> in South Florida. It’s really exciting to see that partners who join the ‘Works with’ program don’t just see it as a badge to stick on a box, but a real chance to engage with, and contribute to, this amazing community.</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>"Many of our users already rely on Home Assistant to power their smart homes, and we’ve seen firsthand how important local control, privacy, and flexibility are to them. By joining the <i>Works with Home Assistant</i> program, we’re reinforcing our commitment to open, reliable smart home solutions. With the upcoming launch of our <strong>Shelly Wave Long Range</strong> devices—offering wireless coverage of up to <strong>1 kilometer</strong> — we’re pushing the boundaries of what smart home technology can do. Combined with Home Assistant’s powerful platform, this will be a <strong>market-leading solution</strong>, capable of covering <strong>use cases no other ecosystem today can reach</strong>. Together, we’re building the future of smart homes: open, powerful, and ready for real-world demands."</p>

<p>In case you didn’t know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work.</p>
<p><strong>What devices have been certified?</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>Whilst the Shelly Wave Pro 1PM sits in an electrical box, the remaining devices sit behind a standard plug, switch or device. This means they are a super cost-effective way to retrofit devices, which in turn reduces e-waste. The Minis are very small (duh), and so should fit in most tight places around the home, even with low-profile installations. The Shelly Wave 1PM Mini is the world’s smallest Z-Wave smart switch. In some areas of the world, you may need professional installation by a qualified electrician, so be sure to check your region’s regulations. If you’re a confident DIYer, Shelly has a lot of <a href="https://kb.shelly.cloud/knowledge-base/installation-guides">helpful guides</a> on their site to walk you through installing it yourself.</p>
<h2>The first of many waves</h2>
<p>These devices are the first from Shelly to join the program, but certainly won’t be the last, as we look forward to many exciting developments with Z-Wave Long Range. Keep your eyes peeled for our upcoming hardware announcement that will work perfectly with our Z-Wave partners.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your support (by subscribing to <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> and <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/#:~:text=the%20first%20boot.-,Official%20Home%20Assistant%20hardware,-Get%20the%20best">buying official hardware</a>), which allows the Open Home Foundation to build these partnerships and certify new devices to join Works with Home Assistant.</p>
<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under ‘Works with Home Assistant does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></p>
<p>A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team yet or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function well but be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program. It may also have a feature missing in Home Assistant that we’re working to add.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Ok, so what’s the point of the Works with program?</strong></p>
<p>A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must work well within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud and will continue to do so long-term.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></p>
<p>A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard HA Green Hub, a Z-Wave adapter and with our <a href="/integrations/zwave_js/">Z Wave integration</a>. If you have another hub / adapter / integration that’s not a problem but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be adding more Shelly devices to the program?</strong></p>
<p>A: Absolutely. Shelly has a huge number of product lines and will be expanding their Z-Wave Long Range list. We’re sure they’ll keep our testers busy with a steady stream of devices to add.</p>

    <updated>2025-07-23T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/07/23/companion-app-for-android</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-07-android-companion/art.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Companion app for Android: It’s been a while">
<p>The Home Assistant companion app for Android just keeps getting better with every release, and recently, it gained some dedicated support to help accelerate its development. Several months ago, I (Timothy Nibeaudeau, also known as <a href="https://github.com/TimoPtr">@TimoPtr</a>) joined the Open Home Foundation as our dedicated Android developer 🎉.</p>
<p>It’s been <a href="/blog/2023/03/30/android-20233/">over two years</a>, and hundreds of thousands of installs, since we’ve published a dedicated update for our community on the development of the app, and I’d like to give you a quick update on recent improvements and what’s coming next.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Behind the Screens</h2>
<p>In the beginning, all of Home Assistant’s official <a href="https://companion.home-assistant.io/">companion apps</a> were developed by the community in their spare time, with many still being part-time projects. It’s incredible the work they put into building these apps. This gives you not just the ability to view your Home Assistant instance on the go (or around the house) and takes advantage of many of the sensors available on the device while providing rich notifications to users.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-07-android-companion/download-growth.png' alt="Screenshot of Android installation growth over time"/>Very impressive growth in installs over the years!</p>
<p>The Android app alone has seen over <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/android">2,700</a> contributions! It’s a lot of work keeping up with Android versions, new capabilities of Home Assistant, and bug fixes. This app doesn’t just support Android phones and tablets but also devices they connect to, specifically Android Auto, Android Automotive, and Wear OS.</p>
<h3>Progress in the millions</h3>
<p>They did all this work while reaching nearly <strong>1.5 million installs</strong>, with over 6 million total installs over the years. There are 400,000 daily active users and 1 million monthly active users. The phone app also has a very nice <strong>4.3-star rating</strong> on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.homeassistant.companion.android">Play Store</a> and <strong>2,800 stars</strong> on <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/android">GitHub</a> 🤩. This feedback really helps us improve.</p>
<p>It’s been over a year and a half since the Apple companion apps gained a full-time developer with the addition of the amazing <a href="/blog/2023/12/27/companion-app-for-ios-202312-lets-go/">Bruno Pantaleão</a> 😎. Around the same time as Bruno was hired, we began looking for an Android developer, and let’s say that took a little longer.</p>
<p>My name is Timothy Nibeaudeau, and as mentioned at the start, I’m your new dedicated Android engineer. As someone who has been using Home Assistant since 2018, I’m passionate about open source and smart home technology. I’ve been working in software development for nearly a decade, developing apps for all sorts of projects from medical-grade IoT products to smart toothbrushes 🪥.</p>
<p>I am committed to bringing my talents to the project, but I cannot do it alone. The community is what makes Home Assistant special, and together, we can achieve even more. Specifically, I’d like to thank <a href="https://github.com/dshokouhi">@dshokouhi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jpelgrom">@jpelgrom</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/JBassett">@JBassett</a> for their years of work making this app what it is today!</p>
<p>I’d also like to thank you! Your support (by subscribing to <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> and buying <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/#:~:text=the%20first%20boot.-,Official%20Home%20Assistant%20hardware,-Get%20the%20best">official hardware</a>) allows the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a> to hire dedicated developers. Dedicated developers keep development focused, helping the community to work together in delivering the feature they’re passionate about.</p>
<h2>Since our last blog</h2>
<img src='/images/blog/2025-07-android-companion/playstore-cards.jpg' class="no-shadow" alt="Google Play Store screenshot cards for Home Assistant"/>
<p>Like I said at the top, it’s been a long time (over two years 🫢) since we’ve published a blog highlighting the improvements made to the Android app. You’ve probably been enjoying these new features for some time, but in case you missed it, here are some of the biggest improvements made by the community over that time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Health Connect sensors linked to your Android phone have been added, including heart rate, fitness data, and glucose levels (as always, you have complete control over what you share with your Home Assistant instance, and that data stays local).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By working with Android <a href="/blog/2023/07/20/year-of-the-voice-chapter-3/#native-assist-on-android">natively</a>, Assist can now replace your phone’s (or Wear OS devices’) assistant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can now set the Home Assistant app as your device’s default launcher, which is great for wall panel setups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ve updated our widgets to support some of the new features, like To-do lists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wear OS has had its Tile capabilities improved and a new thermostat tile was added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are now more Android Auto sensors, like speed and remaining range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A simpler way to connect Wi-Fi compatible devices to your home network (such as the Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition) using <a href="https://www.improv-wifi.com/">Improv Wi-Fi</a> over Bluetooth (an open standard for connecting devices to Wi-Fi using Bluetooth, built by the Open Home Foundation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Z-Wave device onboarding experience has been improved with the addition of a QR code scanner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ve also improved the speed and stability of the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s now easier than ever for new contributors to jump in and start helping with the app (much more on that below 👇).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a full list of the app’s capabilities, check out our <a href="https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/core/">breakdown of the companion apps from the companion documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>What’s next for our Android app</h2>
<p>In our latest update of the Android app <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/android/releases/tag/2025.7.1">2025.7.1</a>, we’ve added a couple of useful features. Including a new basic invite flow, which will be shared between Android and iOS, adding a good layer of consistency between our most-used companion apps. The idea is to make it much more seamless to add new users or set up new devices (no need to type the URL in your Android Automotive device!).</p>
<p>We’ve also made <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/">My Links</a> work better. If you’re unfamiliar with My Links, they’re those cool links (<a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/create-link/">that anyone can make</a>) that bring you right to an integration, blueprint, add-on, or settings page. They have always worked great on desktop, but up until recently, they were a bit clunky to use on mobile. Now you can get to the link’s destination with a single click.</p>
<p>Android has many different screen sizes and layouts, and we’re working to better leverage them with edge-to-edge support. Our recent update has edge-to-edge working on Android native UI elements like the settings page, and we’re looking to implement them elsewhere in future updates so we can make the most of your screen real estate.</p>
<h2>Important changes for Android users</h2>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-07-android-companion/android-distribution.png' alt="Pie chart of installations over different Android versions from the Play Store"/>A huge percentage of our users are on pretty new versions of Android, but we want to support as many older devices as possible.</p>
<p>One significant change on the horizon is ending support for Android 5.0 and 5.1 (also known as Android Lollipop, released in 2014… it had a good run 🫡). <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/versions/all-channel#:~:text=Note%3A%20Starting%20in%20June%202025%2C%20new%20releases%20of%20many%20AndroidX%20libraries%20previously%20targeting%20minSdk%2021%20will%20be%20updated%20to%20require%20minSdk%2023.%20Some%20libraries%20won%27t%20be%20re%2Dreleased%20and%20will%20therefore%20continue%20to%20support%20minSdk%2021.">Google has announced</a> that starting in June 2025, many AndroidX libraries will require a minimum of Android 6.0 (API 23). Google has already updated <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/android#messaging_v25-0-0">Firebase Cloud Messaging</a> to require this as well. This means we will need to stop supporting Android 5.0 and 5.1 (API 21 and 22) to keep up with new features and security updates. Less than 0.3% of installs are on Android versions below API 23 (Android 6.0), and we always work to keep older devices working, but sometimes our hand is forced. If you are using an older device, the app will not be removed, but you will not receive new updates once we make this change. We plan to make one final release for these older versions before support ends. This release is expected before the end of the summer, so you will have the latest updates available for your device before we move on.</p>
<h2>Let’s work together</h2>
<p>We want to make it easier for you to contribute, whether you are a seasoned developer or just getting started. This includes making the contribution journey smoother and giving people an easy place to start. We’ve even compiled a list of <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/android/contribute">“first issues” to tackle for prospective developers</a> looking to help out. We’ve started work on dedicated <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/android">Android developer documentation</a>, which will give in-depth information about the inner workings of this app.</p>
<p>We’ve made many behind-the-scenes changes to improve the developer experience (defining best practices, linters for faster/automated feedback, and continuous integration for quicker feedback on PRs). Our focus is always on improving stability, reducing crash rates, and catching issues early. One example of this is our new fail-fast <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/android/best_practices/?_highlight=failfa#fail-fast">approach</a>, which has already helped us catch and fix issues early.</p>
<p>We want more Android native/exclusive features while also balancing the need to keep parity between the Android and iOS companion apps (the iOS app is excellent, and each app’s community is learning so much from each other).</p>

    <link href="https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/07/15/zooz-joins-works-with-home-assistant/"/>
    <updated>2025-07-15T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/07/15/zooz-joins-works-with-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-07-zooz/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Zooz joins Works with Home Assistant">
<p>Our <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> program is expanding once again, and this time we’re excited to announce Zooz is joining us! We have tested many new devices of all different types, ensuring they provide the best experience possible with Home Assistant. As well as classic staples for the smart home, they also bring some very cool flood protection devices to help safeguard your home.</p>
<p>These will be the first certified <a href="/integrations/zwave_js/">Z-Wave</a> devices added to the program in some time, and are just part of the exciting future the Home Assistant community and Zooz see for this smart home protocol.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Zooz zooms in</h2>
<p>Zooz started out not as a manufacturer, but as a retailer of smart devices. They focused so much on customer support that they soon realized they could do a better job than manufacturers already in the market, and so turned instead to creating their own products. They focus on Z-Wave for its interoperability and security, and they include easy-to-understand installation guides with these devices. They also have a wide knowledge base on their website and a very responsive support team.</p>
<p>As Z-Wave experts, they’re members of the Z-Wave Alliance (where <a href="/blog/2024/09/24/we-are-joining-the-z-wave-alliance-board/">Paulus is also a member</a> as the voice of the open source community). While Zooz is based in the USA, many of their products are available worldwide.</p>
<h2>It takes Zooz</h2>
<p>Zooz has really embraced the Home Assistant community. Agnes, their VP of Brand and Partnership Support, recently spoke to the team over at the Home Assistant podcast about their startup journey. She also came along to our Community Day in Brooklyn, hosted by our very own Product Lead, <a href="https://github.com/madelena">Madelena</a>. It’s awesome to see manufacturers get out and connect with our community members.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="dobq10nGoS0" videotitle="The evolution of Zooz with Agnes Lorenz | Home Assistant Podcast"></lite-youtube></p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>"Zooz has been contributing quality hardware to the smart home community for over 10 years now and our biggest takeaway is that thoughtful integration is key for our customers. We recognize that our devices are part of an ecosystem and that's why we are so excited to partner with Home Assistant, a platform we highly respect for its commitment to making products work together seamlessly. I especially appreciate how quickly Home Assistant embraced Z-Wave Long Range and how easy it is to set up Z-Wave on a brand new system thanks to hardware like Home Assistant Green. We look forward to connecting with the Home Assistant community, learning together, and creating new devices driven by your feedback."</p>

<h2>Frequencies and firmware</h2>
<p>If you’re based in North America, all new devices will come with Z-Wave Long Range (ZWLR) as standard. If you are based elsewhere, like in Europe, Long Range won’t be enabled quite yet. The reason is that even though the Z-Wave Long Range protocol has been available for some time in North America, it was only released in Europe in April 2025, as certification took a bit longer. The nice thing about Zooz’s North American 700 series and European 800 series Z-Wave, is that ZWLR can be enabled via an over-the-air (OTA) firmware update, so hopefully everyone will be taking part in the Z-Wave Long Range revolution soon. Watch this space for a not-so-secret Home Assistant Z-Wave hardware announcement coming your way…</p>
<p>Z-Wave Long Range opens up a whole new world of options and makes for an even more flexible smart home. Maybe you have a large backyard, or an awkwardly shaped long, but narrow home that is hard to get other protocols to cover adequately. Or perhaps you have devices that are just too far away for other protocols. A common example is wanting a way to get notified when the mailbox at the front of your driveway is opened or closed.</p>
<p>Many of the certified devices can function outdoors or be purchased with accessories to make them waterproof. Speaking on a personal note, we had a leak in our garage a year or so ago after some bad weather. Other protocols couldn’t reach that far, and we had no way to be notified. I cannot wait for an easy way to be notified across that bigger distance, and avoid all the unpleasant clean-up.</p>
<p>It’s great to read stories on social media or our forums where smart home devices have kicked in and saved the day, like getting that all-important notification or cutting off the water supply with something like Zooz’s valve actuator.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="7k8Vm-CVhmg" videotitle="Video of the valve actuator"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>Z-Wave, like other open standards we support, works locally, and all of the devices listed above will work locally, without the need for any extra cloud connection or apps. Remember, if you’re also looking for remote access to make sure you don’t miss any critical notifications while you’re away from home, an easy way to get this set up is to subscribe to <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>. Not only will this help you monitor your smart home remotely, but you’ll also be supporting the development of Home Assistant.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under “Works with Home Assistant” does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></p>
<p>A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function perfectly well, but be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program.</p>
<p><strong>Q: OK, so what’s the point of the Works with program?</strong></p>
<p>A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have the expected functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud, and will continue to do so long-term.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></p>
<p>A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard HA Green Hub with our Z-Wave Integration. If you have another hub integration that’s not a problem, but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you be adding more Zooz devices to the program?</strong></p>
<p>A: Absolutely! We’re thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at Zooz to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here.</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to welcome <a href="https://nuki.io/">Nuki</a> to the <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> program! Nuki creates some slick-looking smart locks that you can fit to most doors (or even on top of existing locks). They are constantly pioneering new and exciting features, while also using the open standards we support. Nuki is today bringing three different lock types to the program, all certified by our team to provide the best experience possible with Home Assistant.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Unlocking their origin</h2>
<p>Nuki started just over 10 years ago, with their first smart lock that was called the ‘magic black box’. It was this award-winning design that evolved into the sleek Nuki Smart Locks that are available today.  Keeping everything in the family, the brand was started by brothers Martin and Jürgen. Frustrated with the hassle of carrying a door key in their sports kit, the brothers launched a successful Kickstarter and have been innovating ever since. They design their smart locks in Austria and manufacture them in Europe. Their locks are available across Europe, and in early July, they launched the Nuki Smart Lock in the U.S.</p>
<p>Nuki devices are certified for use with the <a href="/integrations/matter/">Home Assistant Matter integration</a>, which is now <a href="/blog/2025/03/10/matter-certification/">officially certified</a>. Like all ‘Works with’ certified devices, Nuki locks prioritize local control, so you can manage your day-to-day home security without relying on a cloud connection.</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>"Joining the 'Works with Home Assistant' program is a logical step for us. We believe strongly in the power of open ecosystems and giving control to our customers. Home Assistant represents a vibrant community dedicated to innovation and customization, and we are thrilled to align our products with this vision. This integration ensures our customers can build the smart home they want, with the products they trust. The 'Works with Home Assistant' certification provides customers with the confidence that Nuki's products have been tested for compatibility and offer a smooth integration experience."</p>
<em style="text-align: right; display: block;">- Matthias Kerstner, Head of Product at Nuki.</em>

<h2>Devices</h2>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-07-nuki/lock.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Smart lock pro">This lock is turning heads faster than it turns bolts</p>
<p>In case you didn’t know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work.</p>
<p>Our team has been busy testing the Nuki locks for some time and has certified the following Matter-over-Thread enabled devices. It’s important to note that to set up the lock, calibrate it, and activate Matter you will need to use the Nuki app. However, there is no hard requirement for a cloud account or account registration in order to use these locks. Once the device is active and connected via Matter, you can manage it purely through Home Assistant, and can even delete the app.</p>

<li><a href="https://nuki.io/en-uk/products/smart-lock-pro-5th-gen">Nuki Smart Lock Pro</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nuki.io/en-uk/products/smart-lock-ultra">Nuki Smart Lock Ultra</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Insane speeds, literally</h2>
<p>The devices certified include two cylindrical models, the Nuki Smart Lock Pro and the Nuki Smart Lock Ultra, which both feature a brushless motor and three speed settings. The speediest of these is called the ‘Insane’ setting. This ultra-fast setting is ideal for those in a hurry, but you can also pick from ‘standard’ or ‘gentle’ to move at a more leisurely pace. The gentle setting is also perfect for quieter unlocking, so you’re not disturbing others if you’re coming home after a night shift or an early morning jog.</p>
<p>We love that the cylindrical devices come with a rechargeable battery to reduce e-waste. Each cylindrical lock comes with both white and black band options, so you can match your existing hardware or your home’s style. The Nuki Smart Lock Pro can retrofit over a current lock, whereas the Nuki Smart Lock Ultra comes with its own cylinder.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a solid entry-level choice instead, the Nuki Smart Lock Go is a great option, which uses four AA batteries. Both the Smart Lock Go and Smart Lock Pro can be installed in under five minutes, with no drilling or special tools required, which may mean even if you’re renting you could install a smart lock. Works with Home Assistant is all about providing more choice to the community, and Nuki is expanding the smart lock offerings.</p>
<h2>A keyless future</h2>
<p>All of the models listed work locally, as this is a requirement of the ‘Works with’ program so that you can ensure you feel safe and secure in your smart home. However, some users may wish to access these devices remotely too, allowing you to unlock the door for guests, contractors, family, or friends. If you’re looking for remote access, this can either be provided by the Nuki App, or via your Home Assistant system with something like <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> (which supports the development of Home Assistant but also helps bring more ‘Works with’ partners to the program 🤝).</p>
<p>We’re really excited to have Nuki join our certified devices, and see the use cases the community will come up with to integrate their smart locks into the rest of their smart home.</p>
<h3>FAQ ON WORKS WITH HOME ASSISTANT</h3>
<p><em><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under ‘Works with Home Assistant’ does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></em></p>
<p>A: Most Nuki locks will work via Matter with Home Assistant and we have even tried out a couple of older locks with good results. However, we have only officially tested and certified the devices listed above. If there is any other device missing from this list it just means that it hasn’t gone through testing with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function well, and may be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: Ok, so what’s the point of the Works with program?</strong></em></p>
<p>A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. We look for brands that will bring their key functionality into Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud logins, and continue to do so long-term.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></em></p>
<p>A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard Home Assistant Yellow with the built-in Thread border router and our <a href="/integrations/matter/">certified Matter Integration</a>.  If you have another hub, border router setup, or integration, that’s not a problem. We test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: Will you be adding more Nuki devices to the program?</strong></em></p>
<p>A: All of the locks Nuki currently sells are now represented here in the ‘Works with’ program. We’re thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at Nuki to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here.</p>

    <updated>2025-07-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/07/02/release-20257</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><lite-youtube videoid="3MlaIzfRxCg" videotitle="Home Assistant 2025.7 Release Party"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>Home Assistant 2025.7! 🎉</p>
<p>Whew! It’s hot out there! 🌡️ While most of Europe is dealing with a heat wave right now, we’re here to cool things down with an exciting July release that’s packed with features I’m genuinely excited about.</p>
<p>Before we dive in, if you missed it, we recently published <a href="/blog/2025/06/25/voice-chapter-10/">Voice Chapter 10</a> where we explored moving beyond reactive voice assistants that only respond when you talk to them. Instead, we envisioned a future where your voice assistant can be conversational and initiate conversations. Speaking of that, this release delivers on that vision in a big way!</p>
<p>I’m absolutely stoked about the new Ask Question action for Assist! 🗣️ This is something that sets Home Assistant apart from every other voice assistant out there. Finally, your voice assistant can take the initiative and ask <em>you</em> what your smart home should do. No more waiting for wake words, your assistant can start the conversation when it makes sense. It’s the kind of feature that gets me really excited thinking about all the possibilities.</p>
<p>The redesigned Area card is another winner! 🏠 I’ll probably be replacing a few tile cards I’ve been using to navigate to my area dashboards with this new, more flexible version. It integrates beautifully with the Sections dashboard and gives you so many more options for controlling your spaces.</p>
<p>And that’s just the beginning! We’ve got integration sub-entries making integrations even more extensible, full-screen code editors for those lengthy YAML and template edits, and tons of quality-of-life improvements throughout.</p>
<p>Stay cool, and enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>Let Assist ask the questions!</h2>
<p>In our latest <a href="/blog/2025/05/09/roadmap-2025h1/">roadmap</a>, we shared our goal to make Assist more conversational. Until now, Assist was mostly transactional, meaning when you would say something, you would get a response or it would perform an action, and that would be the end of it (unless some LLM magic jumped in). With this release, we’re taking a big step forward: meet the new Ask Question action.</p>
<p>This lets you build custom conversations from the comfort of our automation engine. Ask a question, handle the answer, and keep the interaction going.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="The new 'Ask Question' action" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-07/ask_question.png" />
<p>This action even allows you to define expected answers so that our extremely fast speech engine, Speech-to-Phrase, can train on them. Yes, fully local, custom conversations!</p>
<p>To help you get started, we have provided a blueprint that covers the most common use case — Asking a closed Yes/No question:</p>
<p><a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.home-assistant.io%2Fblueprints%2Fblog%2F2025-07%2Fask_yes_no_question.yaml' class='my badge' target='_blank'><img src='https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg' /></a></p>
<p>This blueprint allows you to focus on what you want to do if you answer positively or negatively to any question that your voice assistant will ask. The blueprint supports 50 different ways of saying “Yes” and “No” (including phrases like “Make it so” and “Let’s not”). Here it is in action!</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="m-Vgr-9DtUU" videotitle="Local conversations are supported with Assist"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>In case you want to dive deeper into conversation building, here is an example on how to ask a question and process the different answers:</p>

<h2>Redesigned Area card</h2>
<p>Originally introduced a few years ago, the <a href="/dashboards/area/">Area card</a> offered a way to display an <span class='terminology'>area<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An area in Home Assistant is a <a href="/docs/organizing/">logical grouping</a> of devices and entities that are meant to match areas (or rooms) in the physical world: your home. For example, the <code>living room</code> area groups devices and entities in your living room.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/organizing/areas/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> overview within the dashboard. However, it wasn’t fully compatible with the <a href="/dashboards/sections/">Sections</a> dashboard, which limited its practical use in that context.</p>
<p>The card has now been completely redesigned with a look and feel similar to the <a href="/dashboards/tile/">Tile card</a>. It integrates seamlessly into the Sections dashboard thanks to its flexible layouts. You can choose between a compact version that shows only an icon and the area name, or a more detailed view featuring elements like your camera feed and buttons to toggle your lights or fans.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing multiple configurations of the revamped area card." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-07/area-card.png" />
<p>The control section itself has also been revamped, allowing you to choose which controls to include and rearrange them as you want. As a result of these changes, if you’re currently using the area cards, you’ll need to reconfigure the controls on them.</p>
<p>Additionally, the card now supports controlling <a href="/integrations/cover/">cover</a> <span class='terminology'>entities<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant. Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other entities. An entity is usually part of a device or a service.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/entities_domains/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>.</p>
<h2>Improving the Areas dashboard overview</h2>
<p>The April release introduced an experimental <a href="/dashboards/dashboards/#areas-dashboard">Areas dashboard</a>, designed to automatically generate a ready-to-use interface based on the configured areas within the home. However, the preview could become cluttered if you had a lot of devices in a room.</p>
<p>This release introduces an all-new overview that leverages the redesigned Area card, making it easy to view and control your main devices by room with a single click. It also acts as a navigation hub, giving you quick access to detailed views of each area.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new area dashboard using the new area cards." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-07/areas-dashboard.png" />
<p>Please note that this is experimental, meaning it is subject to change and may not always work as intended. We would love your feedback if you notice some aspects we can improve. The community’s dashboards, shared over the years, have helped shape this design, and we would love to see how it works with a wide variety of your homes. Even if you already have the perfect dashboard built for your home, try it!</p>
<p><strong>Use <a href="https://forms.clickup.com/2533032/f/2d9n8-32191/NK2MUOVKXQVH2L0NHI">this feedback form</a> to let us know your thoughts!</strong></p>
<h2>Integration sub-entries</h2>
<p>Ever wondered why you had to enter your API keys for every AI agent you created, even though they all used the same key? Or why you had to authenticate for every calendar you added, regardless of the fact that they all shared the same account? Or why you couldn’t add MQTT devices from the UI?</p>
<p>This release solves that with the introduction of integration sub-entries. This allows you to add a sub-entry to an existing <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> entry. In practice, this means that your <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> entry has your credentials, and all the sub-entries use these credentials. In the sub-entry, you can then configure what should be done with these credentials, such as fetching a specific calendar, adding three AI agents with different prompts using the same OpenAI account, or in the case of MQTT, configuring devices that are connected to your MQTT broker.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing how you can now add MQTT devices directly through the user interface." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-07/add-mqtt-device-using-sub-entry.png" />
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> now support sub-entries as of this release: <a href="/integrations/anthropic">Anthropic</a>, <a href="/integrations/google_generative_ai_conversation">Google Generative AI</a>, <a href="/integrations/mqtt">MQTT</a>, <a href="/integrations/ollama">Ollama</a>, <a href="/integrations/openai_conversation">OpenAI Conversation</a>, and <a href="/integrations/telegram_bot">Telegram Bot</a>.</p>
<h2>Integration page gets an overhaul</h2>
<p>The <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> page got a big overhaul! It now has support for sub-entries, allowing you to easily add a sub-entry to an <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> entry along with being able to see which devices and services belong to which sub-entry.</p>
<p>But we took the opportunity to do more. Instead of just showing your <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> entries, it now also shows the devices and services provided by that configuration entry. This makes it much easier to manage your devices and see the relationship between your devices and their <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> at a glance.</p>

<h3>Integration quality scale achievements</h3>
<p>One thing we are incredibly proud of in Home Assistant is our
<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/quality_scale/">integration quality scale</a>. This scale helps us and our contributors to ensure
integrations are of high quality, maintainable, and provide the best possible
user experience.</p>
<p>This release, we celebrate several <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have improved
their quality scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>2 integrations reached platinum</strong> 🏆</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/bosch_alarm">Bosch Alarm</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sanjay900">@sanjay900</a></li>
<li><a href="/integrations/home_connect">Home Connect</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Diegorro98">@Diegorro98</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1 integration reached gold</strong> 🥇</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/ista_ecotrend">ista EcoTrend</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tr4nt0r">@tr4nt0r</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1 integration reached silver</strong> 🥈</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/knx">KNX</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/farmio">@farmio</a></li>

<li><a href="/integrations/telegram_bot">Telegram Bot</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/hanwg">@hanwg</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a huge achievement for these integrations and their maintainers. The
effort and dedication required to reach these quality levels is significant,
as it involves extensive testing, documentation, error handling, and often
complete rewrites of parts of the integration.</p>
<p>A big thank you to all the contributors involved! 👏</p>
<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>
<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.</p>
<p>The following integration is now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/telegram_bot">Telegram Bot</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/hanwg">@hanwg</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are also no longer available as
of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JuiceNet</strong> has been removed as they shut down their API services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other noteworthy changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/shopping_list">Shopping list</a> now has a complete intent function that allows you to check off or mark items on your shopping list as completed, making it easier to interact with your shopping lists using voice commands. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/Lesekater">@Lesekater</a>!</li>
<li>Device and <span class='terminology'>entity<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant. Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other entities. An entity is usually part of a device or a service.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/entities_domains/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> management got better! <a href="https://github.com/emontnemery">@emontnemery</a> made it so Home Assistant now restores user customizations when you re-add deleted devices or <span class='terminology'>entities<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant. Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other entities. An entity is usually part of a device or a service.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/entities_domains/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>. No more losing your carefully crafted names and settings!</li>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/template">Template</a> <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> received a major boost from <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a>! You can now use variables, icons, and pictures across all compatible template platforms, create trigger-based template alarm control panels, locks, vacuum <span class='terminology'>entities<span class='terminology-tooltip'>An entity represents a sensor, actor, or function in Home Assistant. Entities are used to monitor physical properties or to control other entities. An entity is usually part of a device or a service.<a class='terminology-link' href='/docs/configuration/entities_domains/'> [Learn more]</a></span></span>, and fans. Plus, there’s a new <code>label_description</code> template method that allows you to dynamically fetch the description you’ve added to a label from your templates. This is a noteworthy enhancement for better template organization.</li>
<li>Camera snapshots just got better! <a href="https://github.com/edenhaus">@edenhaus</a> added support for taking snapshots via <a href="/integrations/go2rtc">go2rtc</a>. There is nothing for you to do on this one, it works out of the box, but it is nice to know snapshots are now faster and take fewer resources from your system.</li>
<li><a href="/docs/blueprint/selectors/#object-selector">Object selectors</a> now support fields and multiple selections, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a>. These additions are particularly interesting for <span class='terminology'>integration<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> and blueprint developers, as they provide much more flexibility in your UI representations.</li>
<li>Wind direction sensors got a visual upgrade with <a href="https://github.com/edenhaus">@edenhaus</a> adding range icons for the <code>wind_direction</code> sensor device class. Different icons are now shown depending on the state of wind direction sensors, which is indeed a nice visual upgrade!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Full-screen code editors</h2>
<p>Working with snippets of YAML or templates in Home Assistant just got a BIG improvement! We’ve added a new full-screen mode for all code editors throughout the interface.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="VfwcYp7zQzo" videotitle="Full screen code editors in Home Assistant"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>Whether you’re editing automations, scripts, templates, or any other YAML configuration, you can now expand the code editor to take up your entire screen. This is especially helpful when working with longer configurations or when you need more space to see your code clearly.</p>
<p>Simply click the maximize button in the top-right corner of any code editor to enter full screen mode. Press the button again to return to the normal view.</p>
<p>This makes building a more complex and advanced smart home more comfortable and productive, especially on smaller mobile or tablet screens where every pixel of editing space counts!</p>
<h2>Improved dashboard creation experience</h2>
<p>The dialog for adding a new dashboard has been redesigned with a cleaner interface that matches recent redesigns we’ve seen to other dialogs. This improvement was designed by <a href="https://github.com/marcinbauer85">@marcinbauer85</a> and implemented by <a href="https://github.com/quinnter">@quinnter</a>. Great teamwork!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new and improved add dashboard dialog" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-07/improved-add-dashboard-dialog.png" />
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.7 in July.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/06/26/switchbot-joins-works-with-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-06-switchbot/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="SwitchBot Joins Works with Home Assistant">
<p>Please welcome the latest addition to the <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> program, <a href="https://www.switch-bot.com/">SwitchBot!</a> This year has seen a lot of ‘firsts’ within the program, and this launch certainly keeps up this trend. Read on to see the first <em>Air Purifiers</em> and <em>Vacuums / Cleaning Robots</em>! What’s more, SwitchBot is bringing this first set of devices into the program with multiple connectivity options. Pick from their <a href="/integrations/switchbot/">Bluetooth integration</a>, Matter via a hub, or standalone Matter devices as well. All this gives you even more choice in how you set up your smart home, while providing the best experience with Home Assistant.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Making the Switch…Bot</h2>
<p>SwitchBot quickly gained traction in the smart home industry with their original finger bots, which sit over non-smart switches and physically press them down on your behalf. Since then, they’ve expanded to include many other smart home devices like curtain robots, hubs, air purifiers, and cleaning robots. We were excited to see these new products in person at CES earlier this year and meet up with their team.</p>
<p>SwitchBot even got involved with <a href="/blog/2025/06/24/community-day-2025-wrap-up/">Community Day</a>, hosting a meet-up in Shenzhen, China. We love that the ‘Works with’ partners show that they’re passionate about engaging with our community, taking the partnership much further than just a label on a box.</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>"At SwitchBot, we're committed to empowering users with seamless and intelligent home automation. By collaborating with Home Assistant's passionate, tech-savvy community, we're able to push boundaries and deliver more integrated, intuitive experiences. Together, we aim to expand what's possible, offering users greater flexibility to connect, control, optimize their homes, and to make it simple."</p>
<em style="text-align: right; display: block;">- Richard Mou - Co-Founder, SwitchBot</em>
</div>
<h2>Devices</h2>
<p>In case you didn’t know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box with Home Assistant. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work.</p>
<p>The SwitchBot team have put special focus on integrating specifically for Home Assistant and have been working hard on their <a href="/integrations/switchbot/">Bluetooth integration</a>. Though the community played a central role in the development of the integration, and SwitchBot is very thankful for this work, they took a more active role in its development.</p>
<p>One of the terms of the ‘Works with’ program is that Bluetooth devices must connect over an integration that is kept up to a certain code quality (we call this our <a href="/docs/quality_scale/">‘Gold tier’</a> on our quality scale). It also must be maintained by the manufacturers themselves, rather than overly relying on community members to do the hard work. This puts the responsibility on the shoulders of the manufacturers to make sure they’re responding to bugs and keeping the integration up long term. If you’re interested in SwitchBot’s Bluetooth products but your Home Assistant system doesn’t have built-in Bluetooth, the easiest way to connect them is by using a <a href="/integrations/bluetooth/#remote-adapters-bluetooth-proxies">Bluetooth Proxy</a>.</p>
<p>If you prefer Matter, SwitchBot also has devices that are certified for use with one of their Matter hubs: either the <a href="https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-hub-2">SwitchBot Hub 2</a> or the <a href="https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-hub-3">Hub 3</a>. There are also some that can work via Matter-over-WiFi as standalone devices. We are currently testing even more of SwitchBot’s Matter devices for the program.</p>

<h2>A smart home is a clean home</h2>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-06-switchbot/vacuum.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="SwitchBot's cleaning robot with an air purifier">Eat your heart out Wall-E</p>
<p>SwitchBot’s K20 is the first cleaning robot in the Works with Home Assistant program as well as the world’s first multi-tasking household robot. This wacky robot can be paired with lots of other items in the range, including the certified air purifiers, to make some really cool Home Assistant use cases. Just imagine, you’re making some delicious dinner, but oh no, you’ve left a pan alone for too long and it starts to smell and burn. You could summon the K20 with an air purifier on top using the Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition. A few moments later, it’s found its way to you and gets started on clearing the air in your kitchen. Plus, as these can both work via Matter, there’s no need for cloud involvement. Some of the items also come with a table top so this device has some great applications for anyone with limited mobility.</p>
<h2>Bot to the future</h2>
<p>These devices are the first certified items, but SwitchBot is working to get many more tested and fully feature-rich with Home Assistant. We’re excited to keep expanding this list over time, but if you can’t wait (and this work is only possible with the support of our <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers), you can see the list of the other devices they are working on <a href="https://www.switch-bot.com/pages/home-assistant">here</a>.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><em><strong>Q: If I have a device that is not listed under ‘Works with Home Assistant’ does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></em></p>
<p>A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might work fine and be added to our testing later down the road. Though it might only have limited functions that are being worked on, or use a connectivity type we don’t currently test for in the program.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: Ok, so what’s the point of the Works with program?</strong></em></p>
<p>A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have full functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud, and will continue to do so long-term.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: How were these devices tested?</strong></em></p>
<p>A:  The Bluetooth devices in this list were tested using a standard Home Assistant Green Hub, the SwitchBot Bluetooth Integration, a USB Bluetooth adapter, and an ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy. The Matter-over-WiFi devices were also tested with Home Assistant Green and our <a href="/integrations/matter/">certified Matter Integration</a>. If you have another hardware setup or integration, that is often not a problem, but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.</p>
<p><em><strong>Q: Will you be adding more SwitchBot devices to the program?</strong></em></p>
<p>A: Absolutely! SwitchBot has a quickly growing set of product lines that we’re working to certify together, subject to the integrations fully covering all the functions.</p>

    <link href="https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/06/25/voice-chapter-10/"/>
    <updated>2025-06-25T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/06/25/voice-chapter-10</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-06-voice-chapter-10/art.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Chapter 10 of our ongoing voice series">
<p>Welcome to Voice chapter 10 🎉, <a href="/blog/categories/assist/">a series</a> where we share all the key developments in Open Voice. This chapter includes improvements across every element of Open Voice. Improvements that allow it to support more languages, be used on more hardware, make it easier to contribute to, all while making it faster and more reliable.</p>
<h2>Help steer Open Voice</h2>
<p>Before we get going, we just want to say that Voice Chapter 10 isn’t just a broadcast; <strong>it’s an invitation</strong> ✉️. Our <strong>public Voice project board</strong> lives on GitHub, and it shows what we’re fixing, currently building, and what we’ll work on next. Every card is open for comments, so please feel free to have a look and participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>👉 <strong>Project board</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/OHF-Voice/projects/2">https://github.com/orgs/OHF-Voice/projects/2</a><!--more--></p>
<h2>ESPHome gains a voice</h2>
<p>When we began designing and building the firmware for our open voice assistant hardware, the <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>, we had several specific features in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run wake words on the device.</li>
<li>Use a fully open-sourced media player platform that can decode music from high-quality sources.</li>
<li>Wake words can be enabled and disabled on the fly; for example, “stop” is only activated when a long-running announcement is playing or when a timer is ringing.</li>
<li>Mix voice assistant announcements on top of reduced volume (a.k.a. “ducked”) music.</li>
</ol>
<p>These features needed to run within ESPHome, the software that powers the device. In the beginning, ESPHome could only do 1 and 2, but not even at the same time!</p>
<p>To include all these features, we initially built them as external components, allowing us to iterate fast (and of course break many things along the way). We always intended to bring these components into ESPHome, and the process of bringing them in is called <em>upstreaming</em>. This would allow anyone to easily build a voice assistant that includes all the features of Voice Preview Edition, and that’s what we’ve been working on since its launch last December.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-06-voice-chapter-10/devices.jpg' alt="S3 Box 3 next to Voice Preview Edition"/>No device left behind!</p>
<p>ESPHome version 2025.5.0 has all these components included!  We didn’t just spend this time copying the code over, but we also worked hard to improve it by making it more generalizable, easier to configure, and much faster.</p>
<p>As an example of these speed improvements, the highest CPU load on the Voice Preview Edition happens when music is being mixed with a long announcement. In this situation, it is decoding two different FLAC audio streams while also running three microWakeWord models (a Voice Activity Detector, “Okay Nabu”, and “Stop”). With the original December firmware, this used 72% of the CPU 😅. With the new optimizations, which are all now available in ESPHome, the current Voice Preview Edition firmware only uses 35%❗ These improvements even allow the extremely resource-constrained ATOM Echo to support many of these features, including media playback and continuing conversations.</p>
<h2>Make your own Voice Preview Edition</h2>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-06-voice-chapter-10/circuits.png' alt="Circuit schematics to help display how components work together"/>I'll just pretend I understand all this</p>
<p>Speaking of voice hardware becoming more like Voice Preview Edition, why not use that class-leading hardware as the basis for your own creations? We’ve now got the KiCad project files, which include the electrical schematic and circuit board layout, along with other helpful documents <a href="https://github.com/NabuCasa/home-assistant-voice-pe">available for download on GitHub</a>. Combined with our open source firmware files, this will allow anyone to build on the work we’ve done and make the open voice assistant of their dreams. Bigger speaker, built-in presence sensor, a display featuring a smiling Nabu mascot — the options are nearly endless. Building Voice Preview Edition was always meant to bootstrap an entire ecosystem of voice hardware, and we’re already seeing some amazing creations with this open technology.</p>
<h2>Now you’re speaking my language</h2>
<h3>Speech-to-Phrase gets more fluent</h3>
<p><a href="/blog/2025/02/13/voice-chapter-9-speech-to-phrase/#voice-for-the-masses">In case you missed it</a>, we built our own locally run speech-to-text (STT) tool that can run fast even on hardware-constrained devices. <a href="https://github.com/OHF-Voice/speech-to-phrase">Speech-to-Phrase</a> works slightly differently from other STT tools, as it only accepts specific predetermined phrases, hence the name. We have been making large strides in making this the best option for local and private voice control in the home.</p>
<p>The sentence format for Speech-to-Phrase is getting an upgrade! Besides making it simpler for community members to contribute, it now allows for more thorough testing to ensure compatibility with existing Home Assistant commands.</p>
<p>We have also begun experimenting with more precise sentence generation, restricting sentences like “set the {light} to red” only to lights that support setting color. Another improvement is making Speech-to-Phrase more careful about combining names and articles in certain languages. For instance, in French, a device or entity that starts with a vowel or an “h” will have an “l” apostrophe at its beginning, such as l’humidificateur or l’entrée. Allowing Speech-to-Phrase to understand this avoids it guessing pronunciations for nonsensical combinations.</p>
<p>Speech-to-Phrase currently supports <strong>six languages</strong>, namely English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, and Italian. We are now engaging with language leaders to add support for Russian, Czech, Catalan, Greek, Romanian, Portuguese, Polish, Hindi, Basque, Finnish, Mongolian, Slovenian, Swahili, Thai, and Turkish — this takes our language support to <strong>21 languages</strong> 🥳!</p>
<p>These new models were originally trained by community members from the <a href="https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT-models">Coqui STT</a> project (which is now defunct, but luckily their work was open source — <em>another example of FOSS saving the day</em>), and we are very grateful for the chance to use them! Performance and accuracy vary heavily by language, and we may need to train our own models based on feedback from our community.</p>
<h3>Piper is growing in volume</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl">Piper</a> is another tool we built for local and private voice in the home, and it quickly turns text into natural-sounding speech. Piper is becoming one of the most comprehensive open source text-to-speech options available and has really been building momentum. Recently, we have added support for new languages and provided additional voices for existing ones, including,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dutch</strong> - Pim and Ronnie - <em>new voices</em></li>
<li><strong>Portuguese (Brazilian)</strong> - Cadu and Jeff - <em>new voices</em></li>
<li><strong>Persian/Farsi</strong> - Reza_ibrahim and Ganji - <em>new language</em></li>
<li><strong>Welsh</strong> - Bu_tts - <em>new voices</em></li>
<li><strong>Swedish</strong> - Lisa - <em>new voices</em></li>
<li><strong>Malayalam</strong> - Arjun and Meera - <em>new language</em></li>
<li><strong>Nepali</strong> - Chitwan - <em>new voices</em></li>
<li><strong>Latvian</strong> - aivar- <em>new voices</em></li>
<li><strong>Slovenian</strong> - artur - <em>new voices</em></li>
<li><strong>Slovak</strong> - lili - <em>new voices</em></li>
<li><strong>English</strong> - Sam (non-binary) and Reza_ibrahim - <em>new voices</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This brings Piper’s supported languages and dialects from 34 to now 39 🙌! This allows a nice majority of the world’s population (give or take 3 billion people) the ability to generate speech in their native tongue 😎!</p>
<h3>Scoring language support</h3>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-06-voice-chapter-10/intents.png' alt="Scoring table of our supported intents by language"/>This is the score sheet for just intents... it can get complicated</p>
<p>Home Assistant users, when starting their voice journey, typically ask one question first: “Is my language supported?” Due to how flexible voice assistants in Home Assistant are, this seemingly simple question is quite complicated to answer! At a high level, a voice assistant needs to convert your spoken audio into text (speech-to-text), figure out what you want it to do (intent recognition), and then respond back to you (text-to-speech). Each part of this pipeline can be mixed and matched, and intent recognition can even be augmented with a fallback to a large language model (LLM), which is great at untangling misunderstood words or complex queries.</p>
<p>Considering the whole pipeline, the question “Is my language supported?” becomes “How well does each part support my language?” For Home Assistant Cloud, which uses Microsoft Azure for voice services, we can be confident that all supported languages work well.</p>
<p>Local options like <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">Whisper</a> (speech-to-text) and, to a lesser extent, Piper (text-to-speech), may technically support a language but perform poorly in practice or within the limits of a user’s hardware. Whisper, for example, has models with different sizes that require more powerful hardware to run as they get larger. A language like French may work well enough with the largest Whisper model (which requires a GPU), but is unusable on a Raspberry Pi or even an N100-class PC.</p>
<p>Our own Speech-to-Phrase system supports French well and runs well on a Raspberry Pi 4 or <a href="/green/">Home Assistant Green</a>. The trade-off is that only a limited set of pre-defined voice commands are supported, so you can’t use an LLM as a fallback (because unexpected commands can’t be converted into text for the LLM to process).</p>
<p>Finally, of course, not everyone wants to (or can) be reliant on the cloud, and they need a fully local voice assistant. This means that language support depends as much on the user’s preferences as their hardware and the available voice services. For these reasons, we have split out language support into three categories based on specific combinations of services:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Cloud</strong></em> - Home Assistant Cloud</li>
<li><em><strong>Focused Local</strong></em> - Speech-to-Phrase and Piper</li>
<li><em><strong>Full Local</strong></em> - Whisper and Piper</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category is given a score from 0 to 3, with 0 meaning it is unsupported and 3 meaning it is fully supported. Users who choose Home Assistant Cloud can look at the Cloud score to determine the level of language support. For users wanting a local voice assistant, they will need to decide between Focused Local (limited commands for low-powered hardware) and Fully Local (open-ended commands for high-powered hardware). Importantly, these scores take into account the availability of voice commands translated by our language leaders. A language’s score in every category will be lowered if it has minimal coverage of useful voice commands.</p>
<p>With these language scores, we hope users will be able to make informed decisions when starting on their voice journeys in Home Assistant. They’re currently featured in our voice setup wizard in Home Assistant, and on our <a href="/voice_control/#supported-languages-and-sentences">language support page</a>.</p>
<h2>What’s in a name</h2>
<p>Voice commands in Home Assistant trigger <em>intents</em>, which are flexible actions that use names instead of IDs. Intents handle things like turning devices on or off, or adjusting the color of lights. Until now, sentence translations focused on whether a language supported an intent (like turning devices on/off) but didn’t clearly show whether the command supported device names, areas names, or both. This can change from language to language, which made gaps hard to spot. We’re switching to a new format that highlights these combinations, making it easier for contributors to see what names are supported, which should make for simpler translations.</p>
<h2>Continued conversation updates</h2>
<p>Since the last voice chapter, the voice team has worked on making Assist more conversational for LLM-based agents. We started with LLM-based agents because it was simpler to iterate on. If the LLM returns with a question, we will detect that and keep the conversation going, without the need for you to say “Ok Nabu” again.</p>
<p>On top of that, you can now initiate a conversation with a new action called <code>start_conversation</code> directly from an automation, or a dashboard. This provides the full spectrum of conversation to LLM-based agents.</p>
<p>Here is a quick demonstration of two features working hand-in-hand:</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="dq7--T_pVNA" videotitle="Continued conversations demo"></lite-youtube></p>
<h2>Media Search and Play intent</h2>
<p>What’s great about Home Assistant and open source is that sometimes the best ideas come from other projects in the community. Early on, many people were interested in driving Music Assistant with voice, but central pieces were missing on Home Assistant, such as the ability to search a media library.</p>
<p>We worked hard on bringing this functionality to the core experience of Home Assistant and created a new intent, the <strong>Search and Play</strong> intent. You can now speak to your voice assistant and ask it to play music in any room in your home.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="bPMXz2nI-6w" videotitle="Media search and play demo"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>The intent can be used by an LLM-based conversation agent, but we also have sentences that work without any LLM magic. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/OHF-Voice/intents/tree/main/sentences/en/HassMediaSearchAndPlay">English sentences here</a>. As it’s a new feature, support may vary based on your language, and please be patient while our amazing language leaders make these translations.</p>
<h2>Future work - Assist will have something to say</h2>
<p>Talking to your home should feel as natural as chatting with a friend across the kitchen counter. Large-language models (LLMs) already prove how smooth that back-and-forth can be, now we want every Home Assistant installation to enjoy the same experience. We’re therefore zeroing in on three key use-cases for the default conversation agent, which include critical confirmations, follow-ups, and custom conversations. Just note these are still at the early stages of development and it may be some time before you see some of these features.</p>
<h3>Critical confirmations</h3>
<p>Some actions are too important to execute without a quick double-check. Unlocking the front door, closing shutters, or running a “leaving home” script. We want you to be able to mark those entities as <strong>protected</strong>. Whenever you speak a command that touches one of those entities, Assist will ask for verbal confirmation before acting:</p>
  <blockquote style="font-style: normal;">
    Ok Nabu, unlock the front door<br>
    <i>Are you sure?</i><br>
    Yes<br>
    <i>Unlocked</i>
  </blockquote>
<p>Because every household is different, we are thinking about managing these confirmations <strong>per entity</strong> and making them fully user-configurable.</p>
<h3>Follow-up on missing parameters</h3>
<p>Sometimes Assist grasps what you want, but needs more detail to carry it out. Instead of failing, we want Assist to ask for the missing piece proactively. Here is an example to illustrate.</p>
  <blockquote style="font-style: normal;">
    Ok Nabu, set a timer<br>
    <i>For how long?</i><br>
    15 minutes<br>
    <i>Timer started</i>
  </blockquote>
<p>For now, we are still assessing the relevant sentences for that use case. We’re implementing follow-ups with timers, though finding more is not currently our top priority. We are, however, open to suggestions.</p>
<h3>Custom conversations</h3>
<p>As with any other part of Home Assistant, we want the conversation aspect of Assist to be personalized. Simple voice transactions can already be created with our automation engine using the <code>conversation</code> trigger and the <code>set_conversation_response</code> action.</p>
<p>We want to bring the same level of customization to conversations, allowing you to create fully local, predefined conversations to be triggered whenever you need them, such as when you enter a room, start your bedtime routine, etc.</p>
<p>We are focusing first on making custom conversations possible, so that you can show us what you are building with this new powerful tool. We will then tackle the critical confirmations use case, and finally, the follow-ups when parameters are missing.</p>
<h2>Let’s keep moving Open Voice forward</h2>
<p>Only a couple of years ago, voice control was the domain of data-hungry corporations, and basically none of this open technology existed. Now, as a community, we’ve built all the parts needed to have a highly functional voice assistant, which is completely open and free for anyone to use (or even build on top of).<br />
Every chapter, we make steady progress, which is only possible with your support. Whether from those who fund its development by supporting the Open Home Foundation (by subscribing to <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, and buying <a href="/voice-pe/">official Home Assistant hardware</a>) or those who contribute their time to improving it. As always, we want to support every language possible, and if you don’t see your native tongue on our supported list, please consider <a href="/voice_control/contribute-voice">contributing to this project</a>.</p>

    <updated>2025-06-24T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/06/24/community-day-2025-wrap-up</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-06-community-day-wrap-up/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Pictures of multiple community day meetups">
<p>Our first Home Assistant Community Day was a humbling success — we knew that the community had a desire to have something coordinated like this, but we really did not expect just how widely this would spread. 💖</p>
<p>So much happened in such a short window of time, so let’s talk about how this year’s event went and what the future looks like for Home Assistant meetups.<!--more--></p>
<h2>It started with a question…</h2>
<p>Home Assistant Community Day was born from a conversation last year where we asked, “Would the community even <em>want</em> this?” We dropped hints here and there to test how y’all would react to a worldwide event, and after weeks of planning, the response to the event announcement was overwhelmingly positive. 🤩</p>
<p>First, <strong>THANK YOU</strong> 🙏🏻 to all <strong>the hosts</strong> for their local coordination, <strong>community members</strong> who showed up, and <strong>the venues</strong> that made all this possible. I learned so much with your help, and it will make next year’s Community Day one to remember.</p>
<h2>…that turned into a movement…</h2>
<p>When I announced Home Assistant Community Day, I didn’t give hosts a lot to work with. I didn’t want the community to think they had to fit into a specific format, and wanted it to be unique to their region. It became clear pretty quickly what information was missing and what people wanted guidance on. For example, some asked for suggestions on what types of venues to book or which activities could make the event more interactive, such as quizzes or presentations. Your questions helped us make it easier for hosts to build cool events, thank you for those!  </p>
<p>All around the world, everyone came together to talk about Home Assistant (and its related projects). You swapped hardware, you showed off your automations or dashboards, you participated in quizzes, and you formed new bonds with people in your area who share your passion for Home Assistant. Some people had custom swag printed, others received hardware from a couple of our <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works With Home Assistant</a> partners, and one group had a Hackathon event the day before! So many great photos were shared from the events that we can’t possibly include them all here! You can find plenty more by searching #HADay2025 on social media or by checking the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/330944238910963714/1364989531069091920/1375786903324070042">Discord meetup thread</a> for this event. It was seriously one of the most uplifting things I’ve had the pleasure to not only facilitate, but also witness. 🥰</p>
<h2>…but not without complications</h2>
<p>Swag was an unexpected complication. When I first announced the day, we planned to have me order the merch and then send it off to the hosts. This would require collecting addresses and sending packages to people around the world, and we realized quickly that the logistics of that would end up a mess.  Instead, we made the sticker designs (along with the Luma calendar invite graphic) publicly available for the hosts to print something locally.</p>
<p>When we did this, we (as the Open Home Foundation) committed to reimbursing the hosts for these swag purchases, along with venue fees or other reasonable expenses they might have on the day. The idea being that no host should be out of pocket for supporting their local Home Assistant community. You support us (by contributing time or by being <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers), and we want to give back to the community in any way we can.</p>
<p>I’m excited to share that we plan on using those same guidelines for any community meetup, not just the ones that happen on Community Day! 👏🏻 We’re building a new community page where all of these details will be available, so stay tuned for more information.</p>
<h2>Some stats for the nerds</h2>
<p>We had <a href="https://lu.ma/haday2025">82 events</a> with over 1,600 registered guests, spanning nearly every corner of the globe. The events started in New Zealand and ended on the West Coast of North America. This meant we had meetups held from 10 pm May 23 to midnight May 25 (UTC time), that’s over 26 hours of constant partying! 🥳</p>
<p>We had events in every major region except Australia! Most meetups were in Europe and North America — probably not too surprising for most. The smallest events had 2 registered guests, and the event that had the largest number of registered guests was Utrecht, with 200!</p>
<p>With an average of 20 people attending a meetup, we know that we can advise a lower capacity limit for future events. This will be included as part of the guidelines we’ll have on that new community page I mentioned above.</p>
<h2>Keep the fun going!</h2>
<p>Many hosts told me that they’ve created a new space for the attendees to chat or that they were going to start doing some regular meetups (some have done both!). Since Luma worked so well for us for Community Day, I’ve created <a href="https://lu.ma/homeassistant">a general calendar for meetups</a>! I also have <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i7Ta0910ozc66jKqhib5fCrOpYyt9b_J?usp=share_link">graphic assets</a> publicly available for your Luma event and any social media you’d like to post your event on — use the 1:1 ratio image for the invite image on Luma. There are two events live there now, way to go Chile (Santiago) and Belgium (Hasselt)! 🤩</p>
<p>While we don’t have a solid date for next year’s Home Assistant Community Day, I can at least let you know that it will not be in May and instead later in the year. I’m aiming to give you at least a two-month heads-up for when it will be this time. We’re planning on doing something bigger and I can’t wait to do it all again with y’all next year. 😌</p>
<p>P.S. - Did you spot our <a href="https://creators.home-assistant.io">refreshed Creator Network</a> page yet? 👀</p>

<p>Home Assistant 2025.6! 🎉</p>
<p>We are already half way through 2025, can you believe it? I personally can’t, as it feels like we just started the year. Not just that, there are so many exciting things to still come this year, and I can’t wait to share them with you!</p>
<p>Anyway, the June release is here! A week later than usual, but it also means we had an extra week to polish and beta test this release. Like the <a href="/blog/2025/05/07/release-20255/">previous release</a>, this release is packed with quality-of-life improvements!</p>
<p>Last release my favorite feature was the new entity picker; this release, we improved ALL other pickers! No surprise that this, again, makes it to my top favorite this release. Although the ability to group media players directly from the media player card is a close second. It is so nice to see how Home Assistant keeps getting better and better, and how our community keeps contributing to it. 😍</p>
<p>If you are leveraging Bluetooth in your Home Assistant setup, you will also love the new Bluetooth connection graph that shows how your Bluetooth devices are connected, including Bluetooth proxies. Troubleshooting Bluetooth has become so much easier now!</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>
<p>../Frenck</p>
<p><em>PS: We will pick up the regular release schedule again now, so expect the next release on the first Wednesday of July (July 2nd).</em></p>

<h2>Improving all the “pickers”</h2>
<p>Pickers are those dropdowns you use to select entities, devices, areas, and more. Pickers are <em>everywhere</em> in Home Assistant, being used in automations, scripts, and configuration options.</p>
<p>Last release, we <a href="/blog/2025/05/07/release-20255/#picking-entities">introduced a new entity picker</a>, which was a big hit! This release takes things further by refining the search experience based on your feedback.</p>
<p>Even better, that same improved search experience now comes to the area, category, floor, label, user, and device pickers too! They are consistent, fast, and easy to use, no matter what you’re selecting.</p>
<p>And the device picker? It now has a fresh look to match, complete with manufacturer logos and styling inspired by the entity picker.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new device picker, including the area and integration that provides them." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-06/new-device-picker.png" />
<h2>Making sense of Bluetooth</h2>
<p>Home Assistant has powerful <a href="/integrations/bluetooth">Bluetooth capabilities</a>, and with the use of something like <a href="https://esphome.io/projects/?type=bluetooth">ESPHome Bluetooth proxies</a>, you can extend your Bluetooth network to cover your entire home. This release brings some improvements to the Bluetooth integration that will help you understand your Bluetooth network better.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth integration now provides a visualization that shows how your Bluetooth devices are connected to your Home Assistant instance, whether that’s directly to your system or through a Bluetooth proxy.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showcasing the new Bluetooth connection graph; Even Bluetooth proxies are shown in the map." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-06/bluetooth-connection-graph.png" />
<p>It not only shows the actively connected devices, but also the devices that are in range, but not yet known to Home Assistant. This is a great way to see what devices are around you and where they can be potentially connected.</p>
<p>Oh! And now that the Bluetooth integration has a sleek new visualization, the <a href="/integrations/zha">Zigbee integration</a>, which already has a similar feature, has been given a visual update. This makes visualizations consistent across Home Assistant.</p>
<h2>Iterations of the experimental area dashboard</h2>
<p>In the April release, we introduced a <a href="/blog/2025/04/02/release-20254/#a-new-experimental-areas-dashboard">new experimental Areas dashboard</a>, which automatically generates a ready-to-use dashboard based on the areas you’ve set up in your home. It uses sections and tile cards for a modern, clean, and intuitive look — all built for you in a couple of clicks.</p>
<p>As this is experimental, it is being continuously iterated on. This release brings some nice changes, based on your feedback, to subtly refine the experience.</p>
<p>We added a new “Actions” section that includes scripts, automations, and scenes. We also added number entities (and number helpers), button entities (and button helpers), counters, and timer helpers to the “Others” section. This makes it easier to find and manage your automations and scenes in the context of your areas.</p>
<p>Finally, we renamed the “Entertainment” section to “Media players”. This makes it clearer that this section is specifically for your players, and may not include your DIY arcade machine 👾.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new areas dashboard; showcasing the new Actions section." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-06/areas-dashboard.png" />
<h2>Deprecating installation methods and 32-bit architectures</h2>
<p>This release introduces important deprecation announcements, and though they only affect a small percentage of users, it is important that they understand the impacts. We’ve written <a href="/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/">a detailed blog</a> that explains the rationale, timeline, and tips on how to migrate — which I highly suggest reading if you think you’re affected.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Installation Methods</strong>: The <strong>Core</strong> and <strong>Supervised</strong> installation methods are now officially deprecated. These are advanced setups that are only used by a small portion of users, as they involve running Home Assistant in a Python environment or installing the Supervisor on top of your own operating system. Moving forward, we are focusing our support on the more streamlined and maintainable installation methods: <strong>Home Assistant OS</strong> and <strong>Home Assistant Container</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>32-bit Architectures</strong>: Support for legacy 32-bit CPU architectures (<strong>i386</strong>, <strong>armhf</strong>, and <strong>armv7</strong>) is also being deprecated. These architectures are increasingly uncommon and pose challenges for maintaining compatibility and performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To assist you during this transition, Home Assistant will now raise a <strong>repair issue</strong> after upgrading if your system is affected by these deprecations. This notification will appear in the repair dashboard, providing information about the deprecation along with guidance on how to migrate to a supported setup.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while these methods and architectures are deprecated, they will continue to receive support for the next six months, until the release of Home Assistant 2025.12. You can continue to use them after this point, but we would highly recommend migrating. After this 6-month period, they will become unsupported, meaning they will no longer receive updates or official assistance.</p>
<p>If you don’t receive this repair message, you’re not affected. However, you can double-check using <a href="/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/#what-does-deprecated-and-unsupported-mean">our guide</a> if you’d like. We also have specific information on what becoming deprecated and unsupported <a href="/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/#what-does-deprecated-and-unsupported-mean">means for your installation</a>. Lastly, we have detailed information on <a href="/blog/2025/05/22/deprecating-core-and-supervised-installation-methods-and-32-bit-systems/#how-to-migrate">how best to migrate</a> to a supported system.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Integration quality scale achievements</h3>
<p>One thing we are incredibly proud of in Home Assistant is our
<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/quality_scale/">integration quality scale</a>. This scale helps us and our contributors to ensure
integrations are of high quality, maintainable, and provide the best possible
user experience.</p>
<p>This release, we celebrate several <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have improved
their quality scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1 integration reached gold</strong> 🥇</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/switchbot">SwitchBot</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zerzhang">@zerzhang</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1 integration reached silver</strong> 🥈</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/integrations/shelly">Shelly</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bieniu">@bieniu</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a huge achievement for these integrations and their maintainers. The
effort and dedication required to reach these quality levels is significant,
as it involves extensive testing, documentation, error handling, and often
complete rewrites of parts of the integration.</p>
<p>A big thank you to all the contributors involved! 👏</p>
<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are also no longer available as
of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RTSPtoWebRTC</strong> has been removed as it has been replaced by the <a href="/integrations/go2rtc">go2rtc</a> integration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other noteworthy changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A small but neat one: <a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a> made it so discoveries shown on an integration page are now sorted by title. Helpful!</li>
<li>The <a href="/integrations/cloud">Home Assistant Cloud</a> integration will now raise a repair issue when your subscription has expired, helping make sure you’re aware and not caught off guard. Nice one, <a href="https://github.com/ludeeus">@ludeeus</a>!</li>
<li>More backup improvements! 🎉
<ul>
<li>Home Assistant will now raise a repair issue if not all add-ons or folders were successfully backed up. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/emontnemery">@emontnemery</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/agners">@agners</a> made it so that when an add-on is auto-updated, a backup is now correctly created as an “add-on”-backup. Great!</li>
<li>A new automatic backup <a href="/integrations/event">event entity</a> has been added to track automatic backups made by the system. Great addition by <a href="https://github.com/mib1185">@mib1185</a>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lboue">@lboue</a> added support for the <a href="/integrations/matter">Matter</a> pump device type. Another one
added to the list—awesome!</li>
<li>The Template integration got a big boost!
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a> added modern-style YAML support for template fans, locks, alarm control panels, vacuums, and covers. So clean!</li>
<li>You can now create <strong>trigger-based template covers</strong>. Yep, also by <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a>!</li>
<li>The <code>trigger_variables</code> option is now supported when using <code>for</code> in a trigger. A small but powerful feature. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a>!</li>
<li>New template filters! You can now use <code>from_hex</code>, and <code>base64_encode</code> now supports both bytes and strings. Handy additions from <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New sensor capabilities:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Passific">@Passific</a> added a new device class and units for <strong>reactive energy</strong>. Nice!</li>
<li>A new unit for <strong>energy distance (Wh/km)</strong> has been added. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/frenck">@frenck</a>!</li>
<li>Sensors now support <strong>mg/m³</strong> as a concentration unit—another nice addition by <a href="https://github.com/frenck">@frenck</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Arnie97">@Arnie97</a> added support for <strong>liters</strong> as a unit for gas sensors. Much appreciated!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The new <code>recorder.get_statistics</code> action lets you query statistics directly
from the recorder. Powerful stuff, <a href="https://github.com/Hypfer">@Hypfer</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sidebar improvements</h2>
<p>If you didn’t know yet, you can actually adjust the contents of your Home Assistant sidebar. You can change the order and show/hide items by pressing and holding the “Home Assistant” text at the top of the sidebar, or by going to your user profile page and selecting “Change the order and hide items from the sidebar”.</p>
<p>This release brings a couple of much-needed improvements to this feature. When you customize the sidebar, it will now bring up a nice and clean dialog that allows you to drag and drop items to change their order, or hide them by clicking the eye icon next to them.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new dialog that can be used to order or hide the items in the sidebar." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-06/sidebar-customization.png" />
<p>The biggest improvement is actually found somewhere else! Previously, the customization of the sidebar was only applied to the device you made the changes on; and even more annoying, sometimes it would lose the changes, or it would magically forget your settings on our [mobile companion apps] when you switched between your home network (and thus the internal URL). 🥲</p>
<p>In this release, this annoyance has been fixed! The sidebar customization is now stored in your user profile, so your personalized layout follows you across all devices you use with Home Assistant!</p>
<h2>Join/unjoin groups of media players</h2>
<p>Media players in Home Assistant can provide actions for media players to join or unjoin a group of media players. This is a great way to dynamically control your media players and the groups they are in. However, this feature was somewhat limited, as it could only be used as actions within things like automations or scripts.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://github.com/AlexGustafsson">@AlexGustafsson</a> changed that! 🎉</p>
<p>You can now use the media player card to join or unjoin groups of media players. This is a great way to control your media players and their groups directly from the UI.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the media player card providing controls to group media player with the current used media player." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-06/group-media-players-from-media-player-card.png" />
<p>Please note that, you can only join or unjoin groups of media players that support this feature. Unfortunately, not all media players support this, so it might not be available for all your media players.</p>
<p>Anyhow, amazing contribution Alex! 👏</p>
<h2>Reset/restore entity IDs</h2>
<p>You can now restore the ID of an entity to its original value. This is useful if you have renamed an entity and want to revert it back to its original entity ID.</p>
<p>This feature is available in the entity configuration dialog, where you can now find a “Reset” icon on the entity ID field. When clicked, it will restore the entity ID to its original value. Additionally, there is the option called “Recreate entity IDs” in the top right three-dotted menu on the device page, to reset all entity IDs of a device to their original values.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the reset option of the entity ID in the entity configuration dialog." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-06/reset-entity-id.png" />
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.6 in June.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

<p>Met Office <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/datapoint/datapoint-retirement-faqs">deprecated the Datapoint API</a> used by this integration, causing it to stop working. To address this, it is now migrated to <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/met-office-weather-datahub">DataHub API</a>.</p>
<p>To keep using this integration, you will need to provide a new API key, which can be obtained by signing up for <a href="https://datahub.metoffice.gov.uk/">DataHub</a> and subscribing to <a href="https://datahub.metoffice.gov.uk/pricing/site-specific">Global spot dataset</a>. The free subscription provides 360 calls per day, which is enough for this integration to work.</p>
<p>Some sensors have changed due to the new data source:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hourly forecast provided by the weather entity now has actual hourly entries as opposed to 3-hourly in the old version</li>
<li>Instead of <code>visibility</code> and <code>visibility_distance</code> sensors showing a range and qualitative description (such as “1-4 km” and “Poor”), the integration now exposes a single <code>visibility</code> sensor with precise visibility distance in meters</li>
<li>The integration no longer exposes “daily” and “3-hourly” sensors; there is a single set of them now</li>
<li>The integration sensors no longer expose <code>Site ID</code>, <code>Site name</code> and <code>Sensor ID</code> attributes as these don’t provide any additional value</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-05-deprecation/art.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Deprecating Core and Supervised installation methods, and 32-bit systems">
<p>We are today officially deprecating two installation methods and three legacy CPU architectures. We always strive to have Home Assistant run on almost anything, but sometimes we must make difficult decisions to keep the project moving forward. Though these changes will only affect a small percentage of Home Assistant users, we want to do everything in our power to make this easy for those who may need to migrate.</p>
<p>Beginning with Home Assistant 2025.6, affected systems will display a notification after updating, indicating that <strong>support will end in six months (with release 2025.12)</strong> and include a recommendation to <a href="#how-to-migrate">migrate to a supported system</a>. In this post, we’ll go into our thinking on these deprecations and our findings after consulting the community on these changes.</p>
<p>We have deprecated the following installation methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Home Assistant Core</strong> installation method, where you run your system in a Python environment, not to be confused with Container (for example, running your system in Docker).</li>
<li><strong>Home Assistant’s Supervised</strong> installation method, which involves running your own operating system, then installing the Supervisor and other requirements on top of that.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are advanced installation methods, with only a small percentage of the community opting to use them. If you are using these methods, you can continue to do so (you can even continue to update your system), but in six months time, you will no longer be supported, which I’ll explain the impacts of in the next section. References to these installation methods will be removed from our documentation after our next release (2025.6). Going forward <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system">Home Assistant OS</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/homeassistant/home-assistant">Home Assistant Container</a> will become the only supported installation methods.</p>
<p>In the future, only the currently supported 64-bit architectures (aarch64 and amd64) will be used. The following legacy architectures are being deprecated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>i386</strong> (32-bit x86) is an architecture used by Intel and AMD predominantly before 2003, but some later processors still utilized it (e.g., early Intel Atom models).</li>
<li><strong>armhf</strong> (32-bit ARM hard-float) was used by very early single-board computers, notably the original Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li><strong>armv7</strong> (32-bit ARM) was used by a number of early single-board computers, most notably the Raspberry Pi 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are one of the few with a system using these architectures, you will receive a notification after updating to 2025.6, and it will describe how to migrate your system. In six months, your system will become unsupported and will no longer receive updates.</p>
<p><a href="#check-if-youre-affected">Check our guide to see if your current Home Assistant installation is affected.</a><!--more--></p>
<h2>What does deprecated and unsupported mean</h2>
<p>In the simplest terms, deprecation is where you stop recommending a certain feature to users as you intend to remove it soon. As we deprecated the Core and Supervised installations methods today, that means we are now working to remove all references to them from our documentation. The goal is to guide new users towards installation methods we plan to support long term, and discourage the use of those that are being phased out.</p>
<p>Even though they are being deprecated, we are committing to support them for a further six months (until release 2025.12), giving existing users time to migrate to Home Assistant OS or Container. During this time we will ensure these installation types keep functioning as normal during the deprecation period. However, after those six months have elapsed, these methods will become unsupported, which means issue reports will no longer be accepted. As these installation methods are used for the development of Home Assistant, it will still be technically possible to update them. We still would recommend migrating to a supported method, but that’s your choice.</p>
<p>As i386, armhf, and armv7 architectures have also been deprecated, we are currently removing references to them from our documentation. More importantly, they will also be subject to a six-month support window. After that support ends (from release 2025.12 onwards), we will no longer build or release distributions or containers targeting these platforms. This will mean that in six months’ time, there will be no more updates for these systems, and if users encounter issues, they will no longer be able to ask for support from Home Assistant maintainers.</p>
<h2>Why we made this decision</h2>
<h3>Core and Supervised</h3>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-05-deprecation/analytics.png' alt="OS and Container represent the vast majority of installation methods">From our <a href="https://analytics.home-assistant.io/">opt-in analytics</a></p>
<p>The Core and Supervised installation methods are not only complex for users to install and maintain — they’re also challenging for the Home Assistant team to support. In the past, there were compelling reasons, outside Home Assistant development, to run these installation methods, but for most people those reasons are disappearing. Home Assistant OS is very capable with a rich ecosystem of add-ons, while also being easy to run in a virtual machine. Container adoption has become mainstream, now being widely available along with systems having more resources to run them. Steadily, we’ve seen year-on-year reductions in the percentage of Core and Supervised installations (currently standing at 2.5% and 3.3% respectively).</p>
<p>As Core and Supervised are more complex to maintain, they generate more issues that are more difficult to solve. This complexity places a disproportionate burden on our community-driven support system, where volunteers generously give their time to help others. It also takes time away from assisting the vast majority of users who are on the simpler to maintain installation methods. Along with this, new users could sometimes be swayed into running Core or Supervised, and have a bad experience that could cause them to give up on the best way to automate their home. By focusing our support and documentation on OS and Container methods, we can greatly improve the onboarding experience and ensure a smoother start for new users.</p>
<h3>Legacy 32-bit architectures</h3>
<p>Though Home Assistant is very lean and can run great on older or low-spec hardware, the architectures we’re deprecating are definitely on the leaner side of the spectrum. That probably explains why we see such low usage figures, with i386 and armhf architectures representing less than 0.5% of installations each, and armv7 at only 0.95% of installations. More than half of Home Assistant systems using armv7 have hardware that is capable of running 64-bit operating systems, like Raspberry Pi 3 and 4. This hardware can actually upgrade and migrate to a supported 64-bit version of our Home Assistant Operating System</p>
<p>The broader software and hardware industries have also shifted away from these older 32-bit systems. Most have adopted 64-bit architectures such as amd64 and aarch64, and we are seeing more projects we depend on no longer supporting these 32-bit architectures. There have already been several instances where keeping support for these architectures has held back the development of new features.</p>
<h2>Your feedback</h2>
<p>For any major change, it is our goal to make sure the community guides this decision-making. When our maintainers initially proposed these deprecations, we shared this plan with the community (in our forum, GitHub, Discord, Reddit, and other social channels), using it to gather feedback. It was a constructive, civil discussion, and we learned a couple of interesting things that have helped us move this decision forward.</p>
<p>First, our current wording is confusing to the community. Core and Supervisor are components of Home Assistant OS, but are also similar—or the same—as the names of installation methods, which is not super clear for new users. We also found these installation methods being used in ways we never expected, and there are a good number of people who were already running Home Assistant in custom and unsupported ways, not even realizing they were unsupported.</p>
<p>Many of those impacted asked for better guidance on how to migrate. A good number were unaware of our expansion of backup and restore features to all installation methods, significantly smoothing their transition to a new platform.</p>
<h2>Check if you’re affected</h2>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-05-deprecation/system-information.png' alt="what the system information dialog looks like">The blue arrow shows your installation type, and the red arrow displays the architecture.</p>
<p>If you are unsure which <strong>installation method</strong> you are running:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/system_health/">this link</a> OR Navigate to <em><strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Repairs</strong></em>, select the three-dotted menu in the top right corner, and select <em><strong>System information</strong></em>.</li>
<li>Check the Installation type field. If you are running Home Assistant OS, or Container, you are fine as the installation method deprecation doesn’t apply to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/system_health/">same window</a>, you can find the <strong>architecture</strong> as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CPU architecture field will tell you exactly which architecture you are using. If you are seeing aarch64 or x86_64 here, you are fine as the architecture deprecation doesn’t apply to you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to migrate</h2>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-05-deprecation/methods.png' alt="Installation methods and their functionality">Green are staying, and red are deprecated.</p>
<p>If it’s been a while since you’ve migrated Home Assistant systems, a lot has improved over the past several years. Switching systems is as easy as <a href="/common-tasks/general/#backups">making a backup</a>, downloading it, and <a href="/common-tasks/general/#restoring-a-backup">restoring</a> it during the initialization of your new system (Home Assistant Cloud subscribers using off-site backups can restore <a href="/blog/2025/04/02/release-20254/#onboarding-with-a-home-assistant-cloud-backup">with just their password</a>). Every Home Assistant installation method now has backups, and you can restore backups from any method onto another regardless of the differences in architecture. In many cases, very little needs to be done once the restore is successful (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1kdip17/are_you_kidding_me/">to the dismay of tinkerers online</a>). Our documentation has a full list of guides on <a href="/installation/">how to install Home Assistant on different hardware</a>.</p>
<p>Before you think about migrating to a different installation method, you can always choose to stick with what you have. Just because it becomes unsupported by the Home Assistant project, it doesn’t mean you can’t keep running it like you do today. That choice is up to you.</p>

<p>For <strong>Home Assistant Core</strong> users, the closest alternative is Home Assistant Container, which is most commonly used with Docker. If you can dedicate a device exclusively to Home Assistant, the recommended installation method is Home Assistant OS, which gives an appliance-like setup.</p>
<p>For <strong>Home Assistant Supervised</strong> users, we recommend migrating to Home Assistant OS—it supports everything Supervised does, including add-ons. If you want more control over the OS, you can also run Home Assistant OS in a virtual machine, like with Proxmox, or go the Home Assistant Container path alternatively.</p>
<p>For <strong>deprecated architectures</strong>, there is generally no supported migration path using your existing hardware. You will therefore need to find alternative hardware compatible with Home Assistant OS or Container. Second-hand single-board computers and recycled small-form-factor office machines are affordable and sustainable options. In some cases, your system may be running a 32-bit operating system, but is capable of running a 64-bit one (Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 are examples of systems often running a 32-bit OS despite being capable of running 64-bit). In this case, you will need to install a 64-bit capable operating system and restore Home Assistant on that system.</p>
<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>If Home Assistant Core is used for development, and part of the developer docs, why not just offer it to end-users?</strong></em><br />
This is not just about technical viability, it is also about helping and supporting people with their issues, problems, and questions, in our forums and chat. Having these options available to less technical people leads to support queries, and if they have a bad first experience that reflects poorly on the project. Users are free to continue running their systems the way they would like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>No support for Core or Supervised—can I still use them?</strong></em><br />
You can still use them even if we no longer support them. There are many users running Home Assistant in all kinds of unofficial ways. This change just means we are removing it from our end-user documentation and will no longer recommend using these installation methods from an official standpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Will the developer documentation on these things remain?</strong></em><br />
Yes, those will remain. The developer documentation for running Home Assistant’s Core Python application directly in a Python virtual environment will remain. This is how we develop. This proposal is about removing end-user documentation and support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Can I start maintaining these installation methods?</strong></em><br />
While maintaining these methods will require effort, the community is free to move documentation and code to new independent projects. Our maintainers will no longer accept issues or provide end-user documentation, but that shouldn’t stop anyone passionate about them from continuing to run them, or helping others to do the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Can I reproduce any of the installations you offer?</strong></em><br />
Yes, of course! All our pipelines are open source and transparent, you can always recreate any of our pipelines and release artifacts; either automated or manual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Is this the first step towards making Home Assistant closed source/proprietary/commercial?</strong></em><br />
No, that is impossible. Home Assistant will always remain open source. Home Assistant is owned by the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, a Swiss non-profit foundation that is audited and governed, and—by law—bound by its mission. This means it will always be open source and cannot be bought or sold.</p>

<p>It’s been a year since we launched <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/">our first roadmap</a> for Home Assistant, which means it’s time to launch this year’s first update! In 2025, we’re building on our direction to make Home Assistant easier to use for everyone in your household, and taking it to the next level by making smart homes more intuitive, proactive, and user-friendly. 🚀</p>
<p>This centers on helping Home Assistant understand devices in their context, and cataloging every device that works with Home Assistant through a new project, Device Database. And we will do this the Home Assistant way — through the power of our community and our collective intelligence. (…but that’s not all! The roadmap also covers many product areas we are aiming to work on from automation to voice to dashboard <a href="#and-thats-not-all-for-this-year">and more</a>!)</p>
<p>If you’re new to our roadmaps or curious about how they guide the development of Home Assistant, be sure to check out <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-introduction/">our introduction</a> to Home Assistant roadmaps. As always, your feedback is incredibly valuable, so please give us your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<h2>One year on the road</h2>
<p>Last year, we introduced <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/">our very first roadmap</a>—and it wasn’t just plans on paper. It marked a new chapter for Home Assistant: one where we made our direction clear, set ambitious goals, and invited the whole community along for the ride.</p>
<p>In <a href="/blog/2024/06/12/roadmap-2024h1/">2024</a>, we focused on building a smart home that has a high Home Approval Factor: helping both the maintainer and residents of the smart home unlock more value from Home Assistant without needing to be an expert. This was done by improving the touchpoints that all members of the household will interact with, such as automations, dashboards, and voice interactions, while maintaining the power and depth of the platform for our power users and admins.</p>
<p>The real challenge lay in building a roadmap from scratch. That meant not only poring through and prioritizing every single feature request, but also increasing transparency and building trust in the roadmap within our organization and our community as a beacon that can help guide the development of the project. Thanks to the feedback, energy, and contributions from our global community, we’ve made huge strides. In the past year, we tackled some of the biggest pain points, such as drag-and-drop dashboard improvements, automation grouping, standard voice assistant hardware, better automated backups, and more.</p>
<p>Now, in 2025, we are ready to lay the groundwork for the next big step forward: Making Home Assistant <em>truly smart</em> through our collective effort and intelligence.</p>
<h2>The smart home administrator as an inventor</h2>
<p>Home Approval Factor means that a successful smart home isn’t just great for the person who set it up, but for everyone who lives there. Whether it’s your partner, kids, or roommates, we want Home Assistant to feel intuitive and supportive for the whole household.</p>
<p>In some ways, being a smart home administrator is like being an inventor (or, as we would say, a product manager). To be a great inventor, you need to understand your users. What are their needs? What solutions can you invent to solve their problems? How do you know you solved their problems? Can you improve upon the solution?</p>
<p>Home Assistant provides all the building blocks for our administrators to build whatever they want and let their imaginations run wild, and better yet, it’s easier than ever with the improvements we made last year! However, that’s also the curse of a blank slate. Inventing fun and hyper-personalized solutions for niche problems is a major appeal of Home Assistant, but sometimes, maintenance of a smart home can be a chore — not every single problem requires reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>The reality today is that, according to our <a href="/blog/2025/04/16/state-of-the-open-home-recap/#research">community survey</a>, just 46% of partners and only 27% of children of long-time Home Assistant users are directly interacting with Home Assistant. That’s a big gap, and it highlights a broader challenge: Even the most experienced smart home administrators don’t always have the complete picture of their household’s needs. They may not realize what would help until something goes wrong. And it’s unreasonable to expect everyone to be an expert in everything — from automations to dashboards to onboarding new users.</p>
<h2>From shared wisdom to collective intelligence</h2>
<p class='img'><img alt="wisdom spread across social, chats, and videos" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/shared-wisdom.jpg"/></p>
<p>Right now, if a smart home admin wants to improve their setup, they have to go hunting—through our community forums, GitHub repos, Reddit threads, YouTube videos, Discord chats… you name it—trying to find tips and tricks that apply to their specific case. You share incredible wisdom with each other every day, but much of it is scattered, short-lived, or hard to apply without lots of customization.</p>
<p>We believe it’s time for a smarter system.</p>
<p>What if Home Assistant could learn from our community’s best ideas and use that knowledge to proactively suggest improvements? What if it could guide users based on what others have done in similar situations? That’s the vision we’re working toward: using collective intelligence to power a truly smart home.</p>
<p class='img'><img alt="organized shared wisdom is collective intelligence" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/collective-intelligence.jpg"/></p>
<p>To get there, Home Assistant needs to <em>understand</em> what’s in the home. Inside each home, there are the people, the spaces, and the devices. This year, we will start with helping Home Assistant understand devices in terms of (1) <strong>context</strong>: what each device is and how it is used, and (2) <strong>information</strong>: every device that works with Home Assistant and how it is supported.</p>
<h2>Putting Devices in Context</h2>
<p>Today, most devices in Home Assistant show up as a bundle of entities: a temperature sensor here, a switch there. This is by design — we want to provide the ultimate flexibility in configuring your system, and will continue to do so. However, it is not without disadvantages.</p>
<p class='img'><img alt="Fridge as a series of entities" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/devices-without-context.jpg"/></p>
<p>For example, we don’t always know that those entities together form, say, a fridge, which is essentially a mini house of its own: It may have temperature sensors, a door sensor, a light, and so on, but Home Assistant cannot assume them as any other sensors or lights within a room. Without that context, Home Assistant can’t do much beyond letting users build their own dashboards and automations from scratch.</p>
<p>As you add more devices, entities pile up, and Home Assistant starts to lose the thread of what’s actually in the home. Your smart home should become more powerful as you add more devices, but at the cost of the difficulty of maintaining them also increasing exponentially.</p>
<p>When we <strong>put devices in context</strong>, everything changes. A fridge becomes more than a list of entities — it becomes an actual device that can have a dedicated dashboard, default automations, and contextual voice commands.</p>
<p class='img'><img alt="Dashboards, Automation and Voice in context" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/device-context.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here’s how context unlocks a more streamlined experience across the platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Voice:</strong> Assist can currently source the right sensor if it knows the area of the device. In the future, we can also intelligently exclude irrelevant sensors from a voice query. For example, “What’s the temperature in the kitchen?” shouldn’t return the freezer’s internal temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Dashboards:</strong> Integrations can provide customized cards and dashboards right from the start, providing a much more streamlined experience. For example, we can provide a fridge dashboard. It works with other devices, too. Imagine a car dashboard or a 3D printer dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Automations:</strong> By understanding what devices a user has and how they are commonly used, we can intelligently suggest automations created by our community. For example, “fridge door left open” or “fridge water leakage” alerts can be provided without building them manually from scratch.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be a core architectural change that will be proposed and discussed in the coming months. We’re building on what our contributors already share in integrations: knowledge about how devices are structured and how they should behave. My hope is that this will provide the framework for our contributors to contribute dashboards and automation blueprints to our code in exciting new ways.</p>
<h2>Introducing the Device Database</h2>
<p>To make all this work, we also need a centralized, structured place to store and share device knowledge. That’s where the Device Database—a brand new project from the Open Home Foundation—comes in.</p>
<p>Think of it as a source of truth created, curated, and validated by the community. A place where we gather everything from metadata (like power usage or infrared codes) to factual information (setup instructions such as how to add or reset a device) to real-world setup insights and community creations (such as automation examples). It will contain information users intentionally submit to the database, nothing will be collected automatically without your explicit consent.</p>
<p>It’s more than just having all device documentation in one place. We want to universalize all our collective experiences about devices in one place, which is more accessible, centralized, and structured than online websites and chat rooms.</p>
<p>With the Device Database, users both old and new can easily make well-informed choices and pick the best Home Assistant-compatible devices for them based on real usage experiences, allowing them to easily make decisions based on open home values — privacy, choice, and sustainability.</p>
<p>The data will be used and cross-referenced in Home Assistant and other Open Home Foundation projects, and acts as the backbone of their integrations. For example, a future infrared integration can hypothetically benefit from having access to readily available infrared codes from the database.</p>
<p class='img'><img alt="Protocols, device database, feeding choice" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/working-together.png"/></p>
<p>This isn’t something we can build alone. We’re relying on the strength of our global community to turn this vision into reality, and we’re backing it up with our infrastructure, engineering efforts, and partnerships:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a> is here to provide the framework to help us collect and collaborate on knowledge easily and safely.</li>
<li>We’re working with <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">Nabu Casa</a>—our commercial partner—to create the most reliable hardware antennas that support more open protocols, such as Z-Wave, Zigbee, Bluetooth, and more, to expand the Home Assistant ecosystem.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant program</a> is being strengthened to make it easier to find trusted, high-quality devices for the platform, as you may have witnessed with the <a href="/blog/categories/works-with-home-assistant/">numerous new partners</a> joining in the past few months.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result? A system where no admin has to figure everything out in isolation on their own. Home Assistant can suggest, guide, adapt, and point users in the right direction, by drawing from the collective intelligence of the community (instead of scraping user data involuntarily like what Big Tech does).</p>
<h2>And that’s not all for this year!</h2>
<p class='img'><img alt="Devices, Automations, Dashboards, Voice & Music, Frontend" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05-roadmap-2025h1/roadmap-2025.png"/></p>
<p>While device context and the Device Database are the major themes of this year’s roadmap, it doesn’t mean that we are dropping everything else that does not fit. We’re continuing work on other parts of the product experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>A complete revamp of our automation triggers and conditions to make them both easier to use and more powerful.</li>
<li>A navigation and design system overhaul to improve feature discovery.</li>
<li>Continued improvements to make dashboards easier to use out of the box, including a new default dashboard and more.</li>
<li>Enhanced privacy controls for users, guests, and public access (Yes, I am aware of that.)</li>
<li>Easier setup for Music Assistant.</li>
<li>Make Assist more conversational, such as the ability to confirm and clarify a query.</li>
<li>Continued explorations in using LLMs to improve the overall user experience beyond voice.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, we are working on making our roadmap more publicly accessible, so that you can discuss and track our progress with us! Stay tuned.</p>
<h2>Laying the Groundwork for a Truly Smart Home</h2>
<p>This roadmap isn’t about the flashy latest tech fad (what is it now anyway?) or abstract features. It’s about creating the enduring foundation to allow our community to build something greater than all of us together: a smart home platform that learns, grows, and adapts — with full respect for privacy, choice, and sustainability.</p>
<p>The central theme of the roadmap is that making Home Assistant smarter starts with understanding context, such as knowing what devices are and how they’re used, and we will use this collective intelligence to supercharge the main pillars of the user experience — automations, voice, and dashboards.</p>
<p>We’re making maintenance of a smart home easier, by making it less like a mandatory chore while still keeping the fun of tinkering (say, you wanna go wild on YAML), and by creating tools to help admins solve problems they don’t even know they have yet. We believe that, as our advanced users continue to tinker with their systems, their creations and discoveries will also benefit and elevate every user’s smart home.</p>
<p>We can’t wait to work on these initiatives for the rest of this year! Let’s build it together! 🚀👩🏻‍🚀👩🏼‍🚀👨🏼‍🚀</p>

<p>Home Assistant 2025.5! 🎉</p>
<p>It’s time for the May release, and we have a lot to talk about! But before
we do, I want to quickly touch on things that happened in the last month that
you might have missed…</p>
<p>We recently hosted our State of the Open Home event—a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4Vctz1_KYE">live streamed show</a>
where we discussed the current state and future vision of the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>
and its projects, including Home Assistant. During this event, we not only
revealed our roadmap for the upcoming year but also celebrated a tremendous
milestone:</p>
<p><strong>2,000,000 active installations</strong> of Home Assistant worldwide! 🎉</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2025/04/16/state-of-the-open-home-recap/">Read more about the State of the Open Home in this summarized blog post</a></p>
<p>A community of 2 million households is something to celebrate! And we are
doing that by gathering together in person on <strong><a href="https://lu.ma/haday2025">Home Assistant Community Day</a></strong>
on <strong>May 24th 2025</strong>; over <strong>fifty!</strong> meetups are being organized <strong>all around the
world!</strong> Want to learn more? Join a meetup? Or even host one?</p>
<p><a href="/blog/2025/04/24/community-day/">Check out the Home Assistant Community Day 2025 blog post</a> for more information!</p>
<p>Ok, the May release, really, I love this one! It is filled to the brim with
quality of life improvements that I’m sure you will love. 🥰</p>
<p>The quest for a great backup system is continuing this release, shipping
quite the list of improvements, most notably the ability to set a retention
policy per backup location! <a href="https://nabucasa.com">Nabu Casa</a> throws in a
whole bunch of new text-to-speech voice variants 🗣️ <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/config/tts/">included in your Home Assistant Cloud subscription</a>,
allowing your announcements to sound, for example, sad or happy!</p>
<p>But… there is more! Z-Wave gets Long Range support 📶, you can now copy and
paste YAML automation snippets directly in our automation UI, a new tool to monitor the device discovery process in Home Assistant, and–my personal
favorite–the improved experience when you pick an entity anywhere in the UI. 🤩</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>

<h2>Another iteration of the backup system</h2>
<p>In our <a href="/blog/2025/01/03/release-20251/#overhaul-of-the-backup-system">January release</a>,
we did the first overhaul of the backup system. In the <a href="/blog/2025/02/05/release-20252/#iterating-on-backups">February release</a>,
we did an iteration based on your feedback. In this release, we dedicated even more
time to iterate and improve backups even further.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in!</p>
<h3>Per location backup retention policy settings</h3>
<p>This release adds a much-requested feature: the ability to set a backup retention
policy per location. This is particularly useful if you have multiple backup
locations configured in Home Assistant.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup retention policy settings for the Microsoft OneDrive integration." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05/backups-retention-per-location.png" />
<p>It might be that one of your backup locations has more storage space than
another, or that you want to keep more backups in one location than another.
For example, maybe you have space to store the last 3 backups in your Google
Drive, but you want to keep 25 backups on your local NAS server.</p>
<h3>Backup before upgrading the Home Assistant Operating System</h3>
<p>Updating the Home Assistant Operating System is as easy as clicking a button. And while the upgrade process has
a fallback mechanism in case the upgrade process fails, it is always a good
idea to have a recent backup in multiple locations before you start the upgrade process.</p>
<p>To help you with that, the update dialog for the Home Assistant Operating System
now includes the option to create a backup before starting the upgrade process. Selecting this will create a backup that follows the same settings as your automatic backups (and if you don’t have that configured yet, it will just backup your settings, history, and add-ons), uploading this to all enabled backup locations before starting the upgrade process.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the Home Assistant Operating System update dialog, which has a new toggle that asks you if you want to backup before upgrading." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05/backup-before-upgrade-home-assistant-operating-system.png" />
<p>This way, you can be sure that you have a backup of your system before
upgrading, even if something goes wrong beyond the safeguards of the
operating system upgrade.</p>
<h3>Set the default backup preference for upgrades</h3>
<p>The above option to backup before upgrade is great, but the feedback on the
toggle to create a backup before upgrade is mixed. Some of you prefer to always
backup before upgrading, while others rely on their scheduled backups and don’t
want to be bothered with the backup process whenever they upgrade a part
of Home Assistant.</p>
<p>To please both groups, we have added a new setting to the backup settings page
to set the default behavior for the backup before upgrade toggle.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the backup before upgrade toggle preference in the backup settings." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05/backups-select-preference-backup-before-update.png" />
<p>When you set the option to “Backup before upgrade”, the toggle will be enabled
by default, otherwise it will default to disabled. There is an additional
option to set this behavior for add-ons as well, so you can tweak it to your
liking.</p>
<h3>Waiting for the backup to finish on restarts</h3>
<p>Another small but important improvement is that if you initiate a restart of Home Assistant while a backup is in progress, your system will wait for the backup to finish before restarting.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing Home Assistant waiting for backup to finish before restarting." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05/backups-prevents-restart-when-in-progress.png" />
<p>This prevents the unintended situation where a backup is in progress, and you
abort the process by restarting Home Assistant.</p>
<h2>Lots of new text-to-speech voice variants for Home Assistant Cloud subscribers</h2>
<p>If you are subscribed to <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com">Home Assistant Cloud</a>, you
not only get <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/config/backups/">backup storage included</a>,
but you also get access to the most speedy, super accurate <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/config/tts/">text-to-speech</a>
available. If you haven’t tried it yet, now is the perfect time to sign up for the 30-day trial!</p>
<p>This release extends the already staggering number of text-to-speech voices,
but also now includes voice variants and styles. This means that you can
now choose between different voice styles and tones, such as “friendly”,
“angry”, “sad”, “whisper”, etc., allowing you to customize your announcements to
fit the mood and context of the situation.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing a glimpse of the new voice variants for available for Home Assistant Cloud subscribers." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05/new-voice-variants-for-home-assistant-cloud.png" />

<h2>Picking entities</h2>
<p>We are working on improving the context of things shown in the UI. This is to
ensure you always know which device or entity you are looking at, no matter
where you are in the Home Assistant interface.</p>
<p>In the last release, we already had a small noteworthy change regarding this.
We added the device and area to the entity information dialogs, so you always
know exactly which entity you are viewing.</p>
<p>In this release, we have improved the context provided within the entity pickers in our UI. This is the dropdown you see when you select an entity in, for example, a card, automation,
or script. This picker will now show the device and area name as well!</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the new entity pickers, providing more context and improves search capabilities." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05/improved-entity-picker.png" />
<p>This enhancement gradually eliminates the need for you to manually rename
entities or devices to include location information—giving you a much better
out-of-the-box experience with less setup work.</p>
<p>Not only has the visual appearance of the picker improved, but the search
functionality has been completely overhauled too! 🔎 Finding the exact entity
you’re looking for is now significantly easier thanks to a smarter search
algorithm and the addition of more contextual information in the matching
process.</p>
<div class="alert alert-tip">
  <p class="alert-title"><iconify-icon inline icon='mdi:lightbulb-outline'></iconify-icon> Tip</p>
  <div class="alert-content">
<p><strong>You might notice that the entity ID isn’t shown in the picker anymore!</strong></p>
<p>We think we are at a point where you may solely rely on the UI and the
entity ID is not needed anymore. However, if you <strong>do prefer</strong> to see the
entity ID in this drop down, <strong>you can enable it</strong> in your profile settings.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the improved entity picker with the show entity ID in entity picker option enabled in my user profile." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05/improved-entity-picker-with-entity-ids.png" />
<p>To do so, select your profile picture in the bottom left corner of the
Home Assistant UI, and under <strong><a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/profile' class='my' target='_blank'>User settings</a></strong> enable
the <strong>Display entity IDs in picker</strong> option.</p>

<h2>Z-Wave Long Range support and improved Smart Start</h2>
<p>We are providing quite a few enhancements to the Z-Wave integration and
experience in this release. Our commercial partner <a href="https://nabucasa.com">Nabu Casa</a>
is working on a not-so-secret Z-Wave antenna, and we want to ensure that
Home Assistant is ready for it by providing the best user experience
possible.</p>
<p>This release, we improved the whole experience in setting up new Z-Wave devices,
including improved support for setting up new Z-Wave devices by scanning the
Smart Start QR code.</p>
<p>Z-Wave Smart Start QR scanning now works natively in our <a href="https://companion.home-assistant.io/">mobile companion apps</a>,
removing browser limitations. Added devices are immediately visible in
Home Assistant, even if the device is not yet powered on. Once powered on or rebooted, the
device will automatically be added to your Z-Wave network.</p>
<p>The most exciting part of this release is the addition of Z-Wave Long Range
support. This is a new Z-Wave technology that allows devices to communicate
over much longer distances than traditional Z-Wave devices. This is especially
useful if you have a specific device that needs to be placed far away,
for example, a contact sensor on a gate or mailbox up your driveway.</p>
<p class='img'>
<img alt="Screenshot showing adding a Z-Wave device with Long Range support." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05/zwave-long-range.png" />
You can choose if you want to add the Z-Wave device to the existing mesh network
or connect it directly using Long Range.
</p>
<p>After scanning the QR code of a Long Range capable device, you will get the
option to either add it to the existing mesh network or connect it directly
using Long Range. Both have pros and cons, mesh networking is recommended for
most devices, but if you have a device that needs to be placed far away,
Long Range might be the better option.</p>

<h3>Integration quality scale achievements</h3>
<p>One thing we are incredibly proud of in Home Assistant is our
<a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/quality_scale/">integration quality scale</a>. This scale helps us and our contributors to ensure
integrations are of high quality, maintainable, and provide the best possible
user experience.</p>
<p>This release, we celebrate several <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> that have improved

<p>This is a huge achievement for these integrations and their maintainers. The
effort and dedication required to reach these quality levels is significant,
as it involves extensive testing, documentation, error handling, and often
complete rewrites of parts of the integration.</p>
<p>A big thank you to all the contributors involved! 👏</p>
<h3>Now available to set up from the UI</h3>
<p>While most <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> can be set up directly from the Home Assistant
user interface, some were only available using YAML configuration. We keep moving
more integrations to the UI, making them more accessible for everyone
to set up and use.</p>
<p>The following integration is now available via the Home Assistant UI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/integrations/stiebel_eltron">STIEBEL ELTRON</a></strong>, done by <a href="https://github.com/ThyMYthOS">@ThyMYthOS</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Farewell to the following</h3>
<p>The following <span class='terminology'>integrations<span class='terminology-tooltip'>Integrations connect and integrate Home Assistant with your devices, services, and more.<a class='terminology-link' href='/getting-started/concepts-terminology/#integrations'> [Learn more]</a></span></span> are also no longer available as
of this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oncue by Kohler</strong> has been removed because the app by Kohler has been
discontinued.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<p>There are many more improvements in this release; here are some of the other
noteworthy changes this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you know Home Assistant actually has keyboard shortcuts for all kinds of
things? No? Well… if you are curious to learn, after upgrading, press
<code>?</code> anywhere in the UI to see a list of all available keyboard shortcuts.
Nice addition <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>!</li>
<li>Support for the <a href="/integrations/matter">Matter</a> 1.4 water heater device type has been added.
Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/lboue">@lboue</a>!</li>
<li>When setting up a new device in Home Assistant, you can now directly name
it during the setup process. Nice! Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/bramkragten">@bramkragten</a>!</li>
<li>Media players now have an action to search using the <code>media_player.search_media</code>
action. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/zweckj">@zweckj</a>!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/piitaya">@piitaya</a> added a <code>device_name</code> template function to get the name of a device
in Home Assistant. Cool!</li>
<li>The <code>floor_id</code> and <code>area_id</code> template methods have been enhanced by <a href="https://github.com/formatBCE">@formatBCE</a>
to also look for floors or area aliases. Awesome!</li>
<li>We now have support for trigger-based <a href="/integrations/template/">template entities</a> for switches and
lights. Amazing work <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a>!</li>
<li>Support for modern YAML-syntax was also added to the cover <a href="/integrations/template/">template entities</a>
by <a href="https://github.com/Petro31">@Petro31</a>. Nice!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/frenck">@frenck</a> added support for detecting Home Assistant Container installation
types not running in host networking mode. This is important for
Home Assistant to function properly. It raises a repair issue if it detects
this.</li>
<li>A long-standing issue with iOS and the dropdown items in our user interface
has been fixed! No longer will it select the wrong item when you tap on it
while the dropdown is open and the keyboard is shown.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Badges on the dashboard can now be wrapped or scrolled</h2>
<p>A cool little new feature for dashboards landed this release, which we don’t
want to rush past unnoticed. The behavior of the badges in the header of a
dashboard view can now be configured to either wrap or scroll.</p>
<p>Wrap was the original and is still the default behavior, but if you have a lot
of badges and primarily use a mobile device, scrolling might be a better option
for you.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the behavior options for the badges shown in the header of a dashboard view: Either scroll or wrap." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05/dashboards-header-badges-behavior.png" />
<h2>Improved UI experience when using templates in automations &amp; scripts</h2>
<p>If you are a power-user, using templates in your automations and script, you
are probably familiar with the fact that the UI falls back to using YAML for
any action block that contains a template.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a> to the rescue! He has worked on a solution to improve this
experience.</p>
<p>So, instead of falling back to pure YAML for the whole block, it now only
falls back to a code editor for fields containing an action template. This
means the rest of the UI—for all other action fields—remains intact and you
can still use the UI to edit the rest.</p>
<p>As you can see in this screenshot below, the brightness is set using a template,
which is no problem, as the rest of the action is still editable in the UI.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot showing the automation improvements made, when using templates keeping the rest of the UI available in those cases." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05/template-automation-improvement.png" />
<p>This is a great improvement for power users, as it allows you to use the UI
for most of the automation or script, while still being able to use templates
where needed. It also makes it easier to understand the automation or script,
as you can see the context of the template in the UI.</p>
<p>Great improvement there <a href="https://github.com/karwosts">@karwosts</a>! 🙌</p>
<h2>Pasting automations and scripts YAML directly into the UI</h2>
<p>Found this great automation or script example in our documentation or the
<a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/">community forums</a>, but it is shared in
YAML format? No problem! You can now paste the YAML directly into the UI.</p>
<p>When you are editing an automation, you can now simply paste the YAML directly
into the UI editor and it will be converted to the UI format. This is regardless of
whether the pasted example is a full-blown automation or just a single trigger,
condition, or action.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="RRl-G3Igo4E" videotitle="Copy & paste YAML directly into the UI!"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>An amazing quality of life improvement, contributed by <a href="https://github.com/jpbede">@jpbede</a>! Thank you! 🙌</p>
<h2>Discover what Home Assistant is discovering</h2>
<p>Home Assistant is constantly scanning your network for new devices and
integrations using all sorts of discovery protocols. This greatly improves your
experience, as it allows you to easily add new devices to your Home
Assistant installation.</p>
<p>However, sometimes, you might want to know what Home Assistant is seeing
or wonder why a certain device is not being discovered. To help with that
<a href="https://github.com/bdraco">@bdraco</a> added browsing tools for the DHCP, mDNS/ZeroConf, and UPnP/SSDP that
allow you to see what Home Assistant is seeing. It is quite technical, but
it is a great way to see what is going on in your network.</p>
<img class="no-shadow" alt="Screenshot of the new ZeroConf/mDNS browser, showing the internal the discovery process of Home Assistant." src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2025-05/discovery-browsers.png" />
<p>You can find these new tools in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Network</strong>. At the
bottom of that page, you will find the ability to browse all the things
Home Assistant is seeing on your network for each of the discovery protocols.</p>
<h2>Patch releases</h2>
<p>We will also release patch releases for Home Assistant 2025.5 in May.
These patch releases only contain bug fixes. Our goal is to release a patch
release every Friday.</p>

<p>In this release, we’ve made foundational updates to our theming system, which
include <strong>backwards incompatible changes</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Polymer Components Removed</strong>: Legacy Polymer-based components have been
fully removed. As a result, all related <code>paper-*</code> CSS variables have also
been removed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some variables have been <strong>migrated to new theme tokens</strong>.</li>
<li>Others were outdated and have been <strong>removed entirely</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New Typography Variables</strong>: We’ve introduced a new set of
<strong>typography CSS variables</strong> to lay the groundwork for a more consistent
and modern UI.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are part of an ongoing refactor and are <strong>not yet in use everywhere</strong>.
More adoption will follow in future releases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re maintaining custom cards or themes, <strong>please update any usage of the
following variables</strong> accordingly.</p>

    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2025/04/29/eve-joins-works-with-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-04-eve/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Eve and Home Assistant collaboration banner">
<p>We’re thrilled to announce that <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en">Eve</a> has joined the <a href="https://works-with.home-assistant.io/">Works with Home Assistant</a> program! Eve is at the forefront of the Matter standard and has some great Matter devices focused on local control and privacy in the home. They’re bringing a variety of devices to the program, including a couple of firsts!</p>
<h2>Eve of a New Day for the Open Home</h2>
<p>Eve, based in Germany and part of ABB, is known for making high-quality smart home devices. They’ve been an early proponent of Matter, as it really aligns with their philosophy of local and private control. In their own words, <em>“No Eve cloud, no registration and no tracking so your data won’t get exposed. Local intelligence and direct communication between Eve devices and smartphones or hubs without cloud dependency.”</em><!--more--></p>
<p>Eve has had a wide range of devices Works with Home Assistant certified, all of which connect directly to Home Assistant via Matter. If you’re not aware, Matter is an open smart home standard that allows for local control by directly connecting devices to Home Assistant, keeping your smart home data in your home. In case you missed it, Home Assistant is now <a href="/blog/2025/03/10/matter-certification/">Matter Certified</a>!</p>

<p>Matter can connect to devices over Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks, but it can also use <a href="/integrations/thread/">Thread</a>, which every Eve device being certified today uses. Thread devices can be directly connected to Home Assistant using a device like the <a href="/connectzbt1">Connect ZBT-1</a>, or can be connected to Home Assistant via an existing hub (Thread Border Router) you may already have from another <a href="/integrations/thread#google">smart home ecosystem</a>. Thread was designed around efficiency and is excellent for low-powered or battery-powered devices. Also, if your smart home balloons up to a hundred devices (or more 😅), you won’t overwhelm your Wi-Fi router, as Thread operates independently.</p>
<p>Eve isn’t just a fan of Matter; they’re actively shaping the standard. Their team is deeply involved with the development of Matter and the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA), and we were delighted to connect with them at the recent CSA meeting in Chicago. Their commitment runs so deep that Eve licenses its technology to help other manufacturers embrace Matter. In fact, fellow Works with Home Assistant partner <a href="/blog/2025/03/27/motionblinds-joins-wwha/">Motionblinds</a> uses Eve’s technology, proudly displaying “Powered by Eve” on their certified motors.</p>
<div class="alert">
    <p>"Eve and Home Assistant are the perfect match for a local-first, privacy-centric smart home. With Eve devices featuring Matter, Thread, and absolutely no cloud connection in combination with Home Assistant's extensive, local automation capabilities, now everybody can enjoy the smart home the way it was meant to be: with you in control." <em style="text-align: right; display: block;">-Jerome Gackel, CEO Eve Systems</em>

<h2>Certified Devices</h2>
<p>In case you didn’t know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box with Home Assistant. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, and the support of <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> subscribers funds this work.</p>

<h2>Eve-rything You Need</h2>
<p>It is amazing to have Eve in the Works with Home Assistant program, as we’ve been fans of their focus on privacy and local control for years. The list of devices they certified today is really comprehensive, and I dare say you could build a pretty well-rounded smart home just with their devices. There are even a couple of firsts for the program, including their smart radiator valve, outdoor weather sensor, outdoor outlet, and water-resistant motion sensor. Eve is continuously working on transitioning their complete smart home portfolio over to Matter, so if you spot a device that is not Matter-compatible yet - stay tuned.</p>
<h3>FAQ on Works with Home Assistant</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>If I have a device that is not listed under ‘Works with Home Assistant’ does this mean it’s not supported?</strong></em> No! It just means that it hasn’t yet gone through testing with our team, either because the brand has not submitted it for testing, or because the device does not fit the program’s requirements (ex. it’s not an end-device or requires cloud connectivity). It may not be the same polished experience you would get from certified devices, but if you’ve been using the device for some time without issue, nothing will change. Our community is quite good at listing the devices they have confirmed to work on the integration page, so this is always worth double-checking if you’re unsure. We may test it down the road, but it’s up to the brand to choose what they submit for testing, so tell them what you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Ok, so what’s the point of the Works with program?</strong></em> It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have full functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud connectivity, and will continue to do so long-term. If you already own one of these devices, congrats! You’re safe in the knowledge that the manufacturers are committed long-term to providing Home Assistant support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>How were these devices tested?</strong></em> All devices in this list were tested using a standard Home Assistant Green, with the Connect ZBT-1 as the radio for the Thread Border Router, and our <a href="/integrations/matter/">certified Matter Integration</a>.  If you have a different hardware configuration that works for you, then great. The above hardware is just what our team uses to ensure consistency across testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Will you be adding more Eve devices to the program?</strong></em> We are always interested in adding more devices. We’re excited to be working closely with the Eve team and look forward to continuing to bring cool new devices to the program. If there are products you’d like to see certified, feel free to let us know!</p>
