    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/art.jpg' alt="Event Wrap-up">
<p>In case you missed it, we had a pretty huge presence at this year’s <a href="https://githubuniverse.com/">GitHub Universe</a>, their global annual developer conference. 2024 was the culmination of many years of our community growing, and there were some really big moments—our community meetup in San Francisco, awards, rising in GitHub’s rankings, and being a part of the event’s Day 2 keynote.</p>
<p>After a few years of being in 2nd place, we are now the #1 open source project on GitHub with over 21,000 contributors helping build Home Assistant. We also won the Wonderfully Welcoming award for being the 2nd most active project for <em>new</em> contributors. This is really just scratching the surface of the week we spent together in San Francisco, and I (<a href="https://github.com/missyquarry">Missy Quarry</a>, your Community &amp; Social Media Manager) would like to share the highlights with everyone who couldn’t make it this year.</p>

<h2>Community comes together</h2>
<p>What started as a simple request to attend the event tumbled into not only being a part of the Day 2 Keynote of GitHub Universe ❗❗ but being offered a venue at GitHub HQ for a community meetup. It picked up from there - interviews, speaking on panels, and after-parties - this 2-day event spun into a 7-day trip to San Francisco. Not only was this my first event as a part of an open source project, but it was also my first time meeting <a href="https://github.com/balloob">Paulus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frenck">Frenck</a> in person. Paulus is taller than I expected 😅 and Frenck has legs! 😱</p>
<p>While there is a lot of good news for us that came out of GitHub Universe (and I <em>will</em> get to that), I would be a poor community manager if I didn’t start this out with the first in-person meetup I coordinated for Home Assistant. 😌</p>
<p>I knew immediately that I needed custom swag for the event, and got to work with our Graphic Artist, Clelia. We wanted to make sure it was connected to where we were holding the meetup and that it was collectible - we landed on postcards and pins in the shape of stamps.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/postcard-badge.png' alt="postcard and badge">Limited edition San Fran postcard and badge</p>
<p>And, of course, you can’t go to an event without stickers, so we took our Home Assistant and ESPHome logos with an Open Home Foundation badge and made holographic stickers. ✨</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/shiny.png' alt="our shiny stickers" style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;'>
<p>The event itself ended up being a small gathering, but it was filled with amazing connections and conversations. Paulus and Frenck talked for over an hour about the status of Home Assistant and what we’re working on right now, then took questions from the community members. It was great talking to everyone who attended - being able to bring people from different aspects of life together energizes me, and I am excited to plan whatever the next meetup will be. 👀</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/meetup-audience.jpg' alt="Universe meetup ahead of the event at GitHub HQ"></p>
<h2>We are number 1!</h2>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/number-1.png' alt="We are number one"></p>
<p>It was an honor just for Home Assistant to be asked to speak at the Day 2 Keynote; what we <em>didn’t</em> know when we started this ride was that the keynote would announce something new: <strong>we are the #1 open source project on GitHub</strong> by active contributors!! 🎉 Not only that, on the rankings for first-time contributors, we moved up to 2nd place, and an Open Home Foundation collaboration partner, <a href="https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/">Zigbee2MQTT</a>, is also now in the top 10! 🥳 This is all featured in the <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/">GitHub Octoverse 2024 report</a>, which is a really interesting read.</p>
<img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/octoverse-contributors.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="top five projects by contributors - source GitHub Octoverse 2024 report">
<p>Our friends at GitHub did a great job of making sure we were surprised by this news—and believe me when I say we lost our collective minds when they revealed it to us. 😎 We also found out that we’ve won GitHub’s <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/celebrating-the-github-awards-2024-recipients/#wonderfully-welcoming-award">Wonderfully Welcoming Award</a>, which recognizes how we attract and support new contributors to our project.</p>

<h2>Open Source - ⭐️ of the show</h2>
<p>Paulus and Frenck were at keynote rehearsals Friday, Sunday, and Monday to be prepared for Wednesday. So I picked up my badge Monday morning, which was a hackable board with an e-ink display programmed to show our names - the little details they put into this event were quite pleasing. 🤩</p>
<p>There was a community session where GitHub showed off a little of what they would reveal on Day 2. At the breakout session, I was able to share our pain points about moderating a community directly on GitHub, and it was good to hear how other projects do this on the platform.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/day-1-keynote.jpg' alt="Paulus, Frenck and myself at the Day 1 keynote">Paulus, Frenck and myself at the Day 1 keynote</p>
<p>Day 1 is when we had our booth in the <a href="https://github.blog/open-source/10-projects-in-the-open-source-zone-at-github-universe-2024/">Open Source Zone</a>, but I was also set to represent Home Assistant at a panel. The session was called <a href="https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe24/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog/session/1715376172449001OEqW">Cha-ching! How to attract funding for your open source projects</a>; I was very excited to tell our story since Home Assistant is funded by y’all - the community - through our <a href="/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud subscription</a>, and not investors. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that others on the panel shared our approach to building a sustainable project through community support! I had great conversations with several people working on other open source projects like Homebrew and Ladybird.</p>
<p>Our booth was a great success, and we had so many members of the community come up to us to let us know how much they love Home Assistant, along with some people who had never heard of us curious to learn more. We were surprised to hear that some people had not yet tried the <a href="/blog/2024/11/06/release-202411/#sections-dashboard-no-longer-experimental">new Sections dashboard</a>, which we were demoing at the booth. It was really useful to get this feedback in person. All of them took stickers. 😆</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/booth.jpg' alt="Our booth in the Open Source Zone">Our booth in the <a href="https://github.blog/open-source/10-projects-in-the-open-source-zone-at-github-universe-2024/">Open Source Zone</a></p>
<p>Day 2 was when Paulus and Frenck took the stage, and I got there early to ensure I got a good seat up front. We had not only a good crowd in person, but <a href="https://github.com/joostlek">Joost</a> hosted a watch party on the Community Stage in <a href="/join-chat">our Discord server</a>!</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-11-universe/ha-keynote.jpg' alt="Frenck and Paulus on the keynote stage representing Home Assistant">Their final message to the crowd - <i>what are you going to build?</i></p>
<p>The guys did amazing up on stage! 🤩 It was wonderful to see Paulus explain why Home Assistant was built and how it connects to GitHub’s ambitious goal of 1 billion developers. Frenck shared not only what we’ve done to grow the largest open community on GitHub, but also how the community collectively shapes the project’s direction. <a href="https://github.com/kdaigle">Kyle Daigle</a>, a fellow Home Assistant user and GitHub COO, joined Frenck and Paulus on stage and did a really fun Home Assistant live demo. Paulus also shared how he secured the future of the project by giving it to the <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/">Open Home Foundation</a>, and its mission to bring privacy, choice, and sustainability to the smart home. Catch their segment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh9A4LvuGHM&amp;t=679s">here</a>, but I would recommend watching the entire keynote - GitHub is doing good stuff for new developers. 😌</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="uh9A4LvuGHM" videoStartAt="679" videotitle="GitHub Universe Day 2 Keynote - featuring Home Assistant"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>After the keynote, Paulus and Frenck both did interviews, and even gave away an extra Home Assistant Green we brought to the guest speaker representing <a href="https://github.com/hackclub">Hack Club</a>. We spent the rest of the day on the show floor, meeting more of the community and enjoying all the fun.</p>
<h2>Connecting with the community</h2>
<p>It was an amazing event, and so nice to meet my colleagues Paulus and Frenck after months of working with them remotely. Most of all, it was great to meet the community, get feedback and hear how Home Assistant improves their lives. Thanks to everyone who took the time to talk to us! 🥰</p>
<p>GitHub was an incredible host, and it was nice to give something back to them after so many years of support they have given this project. At Universe, they gave us a platform to explain how important our community is and how your support has kept Home Assistant thriving and continuously growing - becoming the top open source project on the platform. The next time you see a blog from me should be when I announce Home Assistant Community Day. 😌</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey Everyone! Today we are announcing our new program called the Home Assistant Creator Network! We are super excited to
start talking closely with creators to ensure everyone has the best information possible. We are looking to invest in our
community and support the effort being put into keeping our users informed. This is a way for Home Assistant to reward these
creators that are positively engaging with our users.</p>
<p class='img'>
<img class="no-shadow" src='/images/blog/2022-04-30-creator-network/Creators.jpg' alt='Creators in the network'>
First Members of the Creator Network!
</p>
<h2>What is the Creator Network?</h2>
<p>The creator network will be a group of creators that are active and engaged with our community with consistent content that
builds the archive for Home Assistant. These creators are creating content for YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc.
with the goal of helping people use Home Assistant. This can be through tutorials, unbiased product reviews, creating cool stuff and more.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to growing this network to be a group of creators that work together with each other and the Home Assistant Developers.
One of the biggest ways we are doing that is monthly calls with the network to discuss releases and upcoming changes.</p>

<p>Home Assistant has a number of tools for working with statistics, but the

<p>This week’s blueprint is that of <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/u/timgiwo">timgiwo</a>,
who created a blueprint that can repeat the behavior of your lights from
the past week, so it seems like you are still at home. Try it out! Read more
about it on the <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/vacation-lighting-replay-historical-lighting/282435">community forum</a> or install this automation

<h2>Slider Button Card</h2>

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">

</div>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mattieha">Mattieha</a> made a <a href="https://github.com/mattieha/slider-button-card">button card</a>
that also included a slider, so you could, for example: switch a light but
also immediately adjust the brightness with the slider. Useful for those who
want to keep their dashboard compact.</p>

<h2>Floorplan Dashboard</h2>
<hr />
<p>This week again we have a new Lovelace dashboard for the necessary portion
of inspiration 😄 This time the one from <a href="https://github.com/theone11">theone11</a>
who has a <a href="https://github.com/theone11/HomeAssistantConfig">dashboard</a> with a
floorplan, definitely recommended to take a look at the repository because
there is a lot of explanation on it.</p>
<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center; margin-bottom:15px">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_AKHEyWXR0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>Would you also like your dashboard to be in the community highlight? Drop it
on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant">Reddit</a> and maybe I’ll pick it out for the next edition.</p>
<h2>Ispindel</h2>

<div style="margin:0 auto; text-align:center">

        <img
            src='/images/blog/2021-06-11-community-highlights/ispindel.png'
            alt="Preview of the ISpindel project"
            style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;width:90%;margin-bottom:15px;'
        />
    </a>
</div>
<p>Between the community submissions, we came across a <a href="https://github.com/alsFC/esphome-iSpindel">nice project</a>
that works with <a href="https://esphome.io">ESPHome</a>, it’s a sensor with which you can
monitor your own homebrew, for example, the alcohol percentage and the
temperature. Cheers <a href="https://github.com/alsFC">Alexander</a>! 🍻</p>
