</p>
<p>We have been steadily shipping updates to our new dashboard design every month since we announced <a href="/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#what-is-project-grace">Project Grace</a>, and our new grid system is finally maturing to a point where we would like our community of contributors to get involved!</p>
<p>If you are a UX/UI designer or a custom card developer who would like to contribute to the Home Assistant project, <a href="/join-dashboard-group">sign up to be part of our dashboard working group</a> and read more about what you can do to improve compatibility of your custom cards.</p>

<h2>What’s new since the last chapter?</h2>
<p>Thanks to your feedback, we continued to build upon the grid system and the sections layout with features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/blog/2024/04/03/release-20244/#define-the-columns-in-the-section-view">Max column option for sections</a> (2024.4)</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2024/05/01/release-20245/#reorder-features-of-the-tile-card">Drag and drop for card features</a> (2024.5)</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#dashboards">Visibility options for sections and cards</a> (2024.6)</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#setting-a-dashboard-background">Dashboard background</a> (2024.6)</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2024/07/03/release-20247/#resize-the-cards-on-your-dashboard">Resizable cards on sections view</a> (2024.7)</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the corresponding blogs for more details.</p>
<h3>New badges!</h3>
<p>In the upcoming 2024.8, we are introducing our redesigned <a href="/dashboards/badges/">badges</a>.</p>
<p>The original badges was created as far back as <a href="/blog/2015/08/31/version-7-revamped-ui-and-improved-distribution/">version 0.7</a> in August 2015, and its design has not changed much since. Designed to sit at the top of a dashboard view, badges provide a summary of the most important information that you need to know, at a glance.</p>
<p>According to our case studies of dashboards created by our users, we found that these badges are underused, mainly due to its outmoded appearance, bulky size, and the lack of configurable options from the UI. Instead, we found that many users are using <a href="https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/blob/main/docs/cards/chips.md">Mushroom Chip cards</a>, created by <a href="https://github.com/pittaya">@piitaya</a> who also works at Nabu Casa, for similar purposes. Therefore, we decided to redesign our badges to match the design of the Mushroom Chip cards.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/new-badges.png" alt="New badges sitting on top of a dashboard view!" /></p>
<p>The new badges feature a wide range of configurable options from the UI. For each individual badge, you can now specify whether the icon, name, and/or state will be visible, and you can configure the contents within each of these components: States can include multiple attributes to be displayed, and icons can be replaced with the entity picture for a person’s avatar or a media_player’s record cover.</p>
<p>Visibility options are also available for the new badges, which allow you to show or hide them based on who is viewing the dashboard, what screen size it is displayed within, whether an entity is in a certain state, and more.</p>
<p>Badges can be easily reordered with drag-and-drop, and they also come with copy, paste, and duplicate features that cards in the new sections view have. Last but not least, the new badges work across both the new sections view and the old masonry view.</p>
<h4>Notes for card developers</h4>
<p>On a default installation, we offer one built-in badge, the entity badge. However, you are not limited to that, as you can build and use your own!
Defining a badge is done in a very similar way to defining a custom card. For more information, check out <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-badge">our developer documentations</a>.</p>
<p>We would love to see your new creations - perhaps a small sparkline graph, or how about a mini progress bar? What do users want to quickly find out on a dashboard at a glance, and what can you display in this small amount of space to get the message across? Let your creativity go wild!</p>
<h2>What’s next for Dashboards?</h2>
<p>As the new sections view matures in its featureset, we want to begin our focus on a bigger task: to revamp all the dashboard cards and bring them up to modern standards. To achieve this, we need you - the power of our contributor community!</p>
<h3>How can we achieve this?</h3>
<p>Once upon a time (I mean, Summer of 2018), <a href="/blog/2018/06/22/release-72/">a group of developers came together to create the Lovelace dashboard</a>. It was built organically - developers contributed where they see a need, either for replicating a feature from the previous States UI, or for adding something that they use personally. While the cards that come with Lovelace are adequate, the usability and aesthetics left much to be improved. In order to raise the bar in our design standards, we need more design-minded contributors.</p>
<p>Enter (semi) open-source design.</p>
<p>Traditionally, open-source projects are built around code repositories such as GitHub. This allows easy submission of contributions by anyone who can code. We figured that we may be able to achieve the same for product direction and UX design, too.</p>
<p>However, it is not easy to start with a blank canvas, and designers and developers have different workflows. Therefore, as the maintainers of the Home Assistant project, we are providing the product goals, the base design framework, and the process to facilitate collaboration.</p>
<h3>Product goals: What do we want to achieve?</h3>
<p>The goal of Project Grace is to make customization and organization of dashboards easy and intuitive for all users in a household. Dashboards are created to help users monitor and control smart homes, and as cards are the building blocks of dashboards, by extension, cards should also achieve the same product goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitor</strong>: Allow users to monitor the states of the device and service entities, with data visualizations that are easy and quick to understand.</li>
<li><strong>Control</strong>: Allow users to control the devices in their smart homes, mainly with touch screens, and on the desktop with a mouse occasionally.</li>
</ul>
<p>To bring them up to modern standards, we want you to join us to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revamp existing cards to fit the new grid system.</strong> This will achieve the modularity and ease of customization we are looking to achieve with the sections view.</li>
<li><strong>Standardize the design system.</strong> The new cards should adhere to the same design tokens for typography, iconography, shapes, dimensions, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Create new cards.</strong> This will fill the current feature gaps that we have not addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Extend existing cards with card features.</strong> Card features allow every card to be more modular and be always up-to-date.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate existing popular cards on HACS.</strong> This will reduce the need to install custom cards and also bring them up to the UX standards of the Home Assistant frontend.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design framework: What will our card designs be based upon?</h3>
<h4>The grid system</h4>
<p>The new cards will be based on the <a href="/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1/#the-grid-system">design grid system</a> as defined previously, finalized with a few tweaks for better information density and aesthetics. We have reduced the height of each row on the grid to eliminate the empty space between the card contents and card features:</p>
<p class='text-center'><img src='/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/card-size-comparison.png' style='width: 66%;' alt='Comparison of the old and new grid dimensions effect on cards'></p>
<p>The finalized grid dimensions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Row height: 66px → 56px</li>
<li>Gutter: 8px</li>
<li>Icon size: 40px → 36px</li>
<li>Feature height : 40px → 42px</li>
</ul>
<p class='text-center'><img src='/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/grid-dimensions.png' alt='Grid size dimensions'></p>
<h4>Design guidelines</h4>
<p>We have also researched on the design of the Tile card, and here are some of the guidelines we have deduced from the research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each card used for controls should have a clear primary action.</li>
<li>Affordance: Everything that is designed to invite users to interact with should look clickable.</li>
<li>Features get better results than icon buttons.</li>
<li>Don’t clutter up the card.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the rest of the design system, we have been gradually moving towards Material 3 for the past year, but we have yet to finalize and adapt it fully on our frontend. We would like to hear your input on how we can bring it to our cards.</p>
<h3>Process: How can we work together?</h3>
<p>Since open-source design is not attempted often, there are not a lot of precedents we can refer to. We are experimenting with our process and will tweak it as we learn more. For now, we come up with the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Working group, assemble!</strong> If you are an UX designer, product person, or a frontend developer, you are welcomed to <a href="/join-dashboard-group">sign up</a> to be part of the dashboard working group! We pick based on experience in dashboard and card design and development.</li>
<li><strong>Meet and greet.</strong> We will organize introduction workshops where everyone comes together to learn about what we can offer and define our project goals.</li>
<li><strong>Start small.</strong> We will parcel out each individual card as a project. We will start with the easier cards first. Every working group member can work on as many cards as they like.</li>
<li><strong>Research and design.</strong> We will quickly research, ideate, prototype, and validate our designs together, and share our designs and work-in-progress live on Figma.</li>
<li><strong>Let’s build it!</strong> We will clean up and finalize our designs, develop the cards, and launch the new cards with the next HA release!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Action items: What can you do as a custom card developer now?</h3>
<p>If you have already created some custom cards, this is a great time to start upgrading your work to the next level!</p>
<h4>1. Fit your custom card into grid system</h4>
<p>In order for your custom card to work well with the sections view, you need to specify the default, minimum, and maximum width and height of your card:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default</strong> width and height is the size of the card when it is first added to the dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum</strong> width and height is the size of the card when its content cannot shrink further in size to adapt to and be usable with the provided area.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum</strong> width and height is the size of the card when its content cannot expand further in size to adapt to and be usable with the provided area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our grid system has a fixed row height, which means that you can estimate how many rows your card will need by dividing the height of your card by the sum of the row height and the gutter.</p>
<p>For more information on how you can implement the card resizing logic, check out our <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-card#sizing-in-sections-view">developer documentation</a>.</p>
<h4>2. Follow usability guidelines from our user research</h4>
<p>Audit the usability of your custom card with <a href="#design-guidelines">the guidelines</a> as mentioned above.</p>
<h4>3. Create new card features</h4>
<p class='text-center'><img src='https://developers.home-assistant.io/assets/images/dashboard-custom-card-feature-screenshot-8425524ea32eb5d4744a7557fcfcab33.png' alt='Card feature example'></p>
<p>Card features are widgets that can be placed inside cards for displaying or controlling an attribute of the entity. By building <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-card-feature">custom card features</a>, you can expand the abilities of many cards that support card features. You can also allow your custom card to use card features, similar to what we had done to the [Thermostat card].</p>
<h4>4. Ensure features are editable in UI</h4>
<p class='text-center'><img src='/images/blog/2024-07-dashboard-chapter-2/card-visual-editor-example.png' style='width: 50%;' alt='Example of a visual editor for a card'></p>
<p>The inclusion of a <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/custom-card-feature">visual editor</a>  is key to the ease of use of your custom cards, allowing more people to be able to edit and use them on their dashboards. Be sure to include only the necessary options in the visual editor, while also hide away the less used options in YAML or in an accordion UI to avoid clutter.</p>

    <updated>2024-03-04T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2024/03/04/dashboard-chapter-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow! At long last!! The stars have aligned, and our experimental drag-and-drop feature for dashboards is finally here! 🥲</p>
<p>Home Assistant strives to be the best smart home platform, and a smart home allows its residents to automate, control, observe, and anticipate the comfort, security, and various conveniences of their home. Besides voice assistants, dashboards are also a great way to help users do just that!</p>
<p>Therefore, we have been working hard to make customization and organization of dashboards as easy and intuitive as possible, and to create a default dashboard that will be more useful, user-friendly, and relevant right out of the box. <a href="https://github.com/matthiasdebaat">Matthias</a> and <a href="https://github.com/madelena">I</a> teamed up in April last year to tackle this problem together, and we called this series of improvements over our current dashboard “Project Grace”, named after the influential and brilliant late <a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/grace-hopper-woman-computer">Admiral Grace Hopper</a>.</p>
<p>After months of user research and ideation to ensure that our design is <a href="https://building.open-home.io/open-home-approval-factor/#home-approval-factor">“home-approved”</a> - to be easy and intuitive to use for you, your family, your guests, your roommates, and more - we are happy to share the first fruit of our success in the upcoming release 2024.3, with the help of <a href="https://github.com/piitaya">Paul</a> and of course the wonderful frontend team. We hope that these features will help you take the dream dashboard for you and your home from idea to reality much faster and much more easily.</p>
<p>For those of you who are curious about the features and the design thinking behind them, read on and check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyBy0ckkiDU">special livestream</a> last week. You can also try out our updated <a href="https://demo.home-assistant.io/#/lovelace/home">demo</a> and get involved by <a href="http://home-assistant.io/join-research">joining the Home Assistant User Testing Group</a>! And last of all, thank you for supporting our efforts by <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com">subscribing to Home Assistant Cloud</a>!</p>

<h2>What is Project Grace?</h2>
<p>Grace was the codename we used for the series of improvements to be built on top of <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2019/01/23/lovelace-released/">Lovelace</a>, the framework for our dashboards. We aim to preserve the strengths of Lovelace, such as its flexibility and extensibility, and to mitigate its weaknesses, such as its steep learning curve, its lack of scalability, as well as the poor responsiveness of its layouts.</p>
<h2>The three-layout problem</h2>
<p class='img'>
    <img src='/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/layout-types.png' alt='The three basic view layouts: Panel, Sidebar, and Masonry'>
    The three basic view layouts: Panel, Sidebar, and Masonry
</p>
<p>Our dashboard came with 3 default <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/views/#type">view layout types</a> by default: Panel, which is simply one card covering the entire view; Sidebar, which is a two-column layout for cards; and <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/masonry/">Masonry</a>, which is the most robust of them all.</p>
<p>While it is excellent at creating a tightly-packed screen space-saving dashboard, Masonry lays out cards in a logic that may not be immediately clear and predictable to many users, which leads to a frustrating user experience to create and customize the layout of the cards. And as the layout logic depends on the height of each card, the varying heights of the cards available for our dashboards become a blessing and a curse: Even a difference in height of 1 pixel would mean a card one would guess to be displayed on the leftmost column getting shifted all the way to the right.</p>
<p class='img'>
    <img src='/images/dashboards/masonry.png' alt='Image showing how masonry arranges cards based on size.'>
    Masonry arranges cards based on size.
</p>
<p>What’s more, unlike most other smart home apps, Home Assistant prides itself on Choice. In terms of dashboard view layouts, Choice means that dashboards should be able to be displayed on any screens that are the most convenient to our users - whether it’s a phone, a tablet, a large monitor, or other display devices. While the Masonry layout is great at making neat walls of cards, as its name also implies, it is a wall of cards which does not care whether the bricks are laid, thus the muscle memory of where users remember the cards will be lost every time the dashboard is displayed on another screen.</p>
<p class='img'>
    <img src='/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/layout-masonry-problem.png' alt='Masonry does not care about where exactly cards are placed when the screen size changes.'>
    Masonry does not care about where exactly cards are placed when the screen size changes.
</p>
<p>For the past few years, we tried to create a more intuitive solution to rearrange the cards laid out by Masonry but ultimately the solutions did not work well for multiple screen sizes. Meanwhile, our users come up with solutions of their own, with many avoiding our default view layouts so that they can create a more predictable and memorable dashboard. As it turns out, “drag and drop” is not just an engineering problem; it is also a design problem.</p>
<p>To solve these problems with our layout, we realized that the Masonry layout, compatibility with multiple screen sizes, and easy “drag and drop” rearrangement of cards cannot co-exist. Over the past year, we ideated and identified a few solutions, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#the-new-sections-view">a new Sections view layout</a></li>
<li><a href="#the-grid-system">a design grid system</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="#drag-and-drop-rearrangement-of-cards-and-sections">a “Z-Grid” auto-rearranging pattern</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s dive in each solution and learn how they work together to make your dashboards easier to customize and use!</p>
<h2>The new Sections view</h2>
<p class='img'>
    <img src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/sections-case-studies.png" alt="Case studies of our users' dashboards"/>
    Case studies of our users' dashboards
</p>
<p>Throughout this project, we have looked at dozens of different dashboards created by you and posted on our discussion boards. One thing we notice is that our more advanced users are all naturally drawn to creating “sections”, groups of different cards delineated by a group title, manually with <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/grid/">grids</a> and <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/markdown/">markdown</a> cards.</p>
<p>Home Assistant dashboards are robust and packed with information, and our users often place dozens of cards for all sorts of buttons, switches, graphs, indicators, and more. By grouping cards into “sections”, our users can reduce the number of items they need to scan through when they are looking for a certain card, as they will be able to look for the relevant group title first and then reduce the scope to scan that particular group for the information. And by packing cards in a section into a grid card, the relative positions of the cards within a section are not affected by changes in screen sizes, and so the spatial memory of the cards are retained, leading to a faster and less cumbersome experience.</p>

</p>
<p>For our new Sections view, we are making these sections as the base unit of the view and we are streamlining its creation and editing procedures. Users will not need to fiddle around with grid cards and markdown cards to assemble a section manually, and instead a section now comes with all those amenities and much more.</p>

<p>Another handy method for adding a bunch of sensors or controls belonging to the same device is to add them from the device’s page.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the page of the device through Settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tap the <strong>Add to Dashboard</strong> button on the screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be prompted to choose which dashboard view you want to add them to. If you choose a view using the Sections view layout, the sensors or controls will be added as tile cards placed inside a new section.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Responsive design</h3>
<p>One major benefit of the new Sections view is that it is now much easier to build dashboards that work with multiple screen sizes.</p>
<p class='img'>

</p>
<p>The view will rearrange the sections according to the amount of space available horizontally, while the number of columns of cards within each section stays the same, thus preserving your muscle memory of where the cards are located.</p>
<h2>The grid system</h2>
<p>Our current dashboard views are organized in columns with cards of varying heights, and with masonry layout by default. As cards can vary in height in small amounts, it becomes hard to predict where cards will “land” when one moves a card to another column, or when screen size changes and moves all the cards, such as when viewing a dashboard on tablet vs on mobile. This creates friction in the customization experience of the dashboards.</p>
<p>Enter the grid system, a bastion of graphic design principles.</p>
<p class='img'>
    <img src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/grid-system-examples.png" alt="Examples of grid systems in use"/>
    Examples of grid systems in use
</p>
<p>Typographic grid systems have a long history in modern graphic design and print publishing, starting from its rise in the early 20th Century during the Constructivist and Geometrical art movements in Europe, which concerns the hidden rhythm behind a visual image. They are easily repeatable and, therefore, practical for generating an infinite amount of pages, yet also ensure aesthetic proportions and consistency for printable matter. They also bring order to a page. It helps users understand the relationship between each element on the page and whether one element belongs to another.</p>

    <img src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/grid-system.gif" alt="The Home Assistant dashboard grid system"/>

</p>
<p>When a UI is designed with a structured layout, that feeling of structure and organization comes through to the user in their first impression.</p>
<p>By introducing a grid system with cards of regular row height and column width multiples, we can help users rearrange cards more easily in a predictable manner, make Home Assistant adapt the dashboards to different screen sizes more easily, and, of course, make dashboards look tidier and more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p class='img'>
    <img width="66%" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/grid-system-available-cards.png" alt="Cards currently optimized for the grid system: Sensor card, Tile card, and Button card"/>
    Cards currently optimized for the grid system: Sensor card, Tile card, and Button card
</p>
<p>To implement the grid system, we are now in the process of standardizing the widths and heights of our cards, starting with the Tile card, Button card, and Sensor card. These cards will occupy the right amount of space in the grid, while other cards will occupy the full width of a section by default at the moment.</p>
<p>For card developers, we will have more information on how to adapt your custom cards to the grid system soon.</p>
<h2>Drag-and-drop rearrangement of cards and sections</h2>
<p>With sections and a grid system in place, we can finally implement a way to arrange cards and sections that is intuitive with drag-and-drop, predictable with how the cards will rearrange, while creating a dashboard that is easy to navigate and remember by visualizing the information hierarchy and not disturbing the spatial relationship between cards. Users will not need to pray and guess where the cards will land when they change their orders anymore!</p>
<p class='img'>

    Comparison of four card arrangement methods
</p>
<p>Throughout the design process, we looked at a few different ways of how cards should be arranged. Ultimately, we chose the “Z-Grid” due to its simplicity, predictability, and memorability as the default, despite it may take up more space than other solutions. The Z-Grid works simply by laying out sections from left to right, and starting a new row when the row is full. The heights of the rows are determined by the tallest section on the row, while the width of the columns remain constant for responsive design.</p>
<h3>How to drag and drop</h3>
<p>While your dashboard is in Edit Mode:</p>

<li>To rearrange sections, simply tap and hold the <img height="28px" src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2024-03-dashboard-chapter-1/mdi-edit.png" alt="Edit icon"/> <strong>Move</strong> handle and then move your cursor or finger towards your desired location. Other sections will move out of the way for where the selected section will drop.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Don’t you love when instructions are so short? Yay to simplicity! 🦄)</p>
<h2>What’s next? Get involved!</h2>
<p>The new Sections view with drag-and-drop is just the first step of Project Grace, a Home-Approved Dashboard. We have a good idea of where we want to head next in our design and development process, but we want to hear from you first before we proceed so that we can prioritize and build a product that will help you the most.</p>

    <link href="https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2019/01/23/lovelace-released/"/>
    <updated>2019-01-23T00:01:02+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2019/01/23/lovelace-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re happy to announce that our new Lovelace UI, which has been in beta for the last 8 months, is becoming the new default interface of <a href="/blog/2019/01/23/release-86/">Home Assistant 0.86</a>. With Lovelace we’re taking a new approach to building user interfaces for Home Assistant. We’re no longer storing the look and feel of your UI in your configuration.yaml, requiring restarts for changes. With Lovelace we’re keeping the UI concerns in the UI<sup>1</sup>, unlocking a whole new set of features:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/dashboards/alarm-panel/">24 cards</a> to place and configure as you like.</li>
<li>UI Editor. A configuration UI to manage your Lovelace UI including live preview when editing cards.</li>
<li>Fast. Using a static config allows us to build up the UI once.</li>
<li>Customizable.
<ul>
<li>Cards have numerous options to configure how your data is presented.</li>
<li>Themes; even at a per card basis.</li>
<li>Ability to override names and icons of entities.</li>
<li>Custom Cards from our amazing community are fully supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class='videoWrapper'>

</div>
<p>In case you’re reading this and want to give it a try right now: we’ve updated <a href="https://demo.home-assistant.io">the Home Assistant demo</a>. It now features multiple Lovelace configuration examples. The demo is fully interactive, including the configuration UI (accessible via the menu in the top right). You can also access it by updating to Home Assistant 0.86.</p>
<p>For a deep dive into all the new features, check out the <a href="https://hasspodcast.io/ha042/">latest episode of the Home Assistant podcast</a>, featuring an interview with <a href="https://github.com/zsarnett">Zack Arnett</a> from the Lovelace team.</p>
<p>For an overview of all the different features, check out the <a href="/dashboards/">Lovelace documentation</a>.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>: If you prefer to write your Dashboard config in YAML, Home Assistant also includes an optional <a href="/dashboards/yaml-mode/">YAML mode</a>.</p>
<h2>Migrating to Lovelace</h2>
<p>You have to do… nothing! If not configured, Lovelace will use the same algorithm to built-up the UI as the old UI did.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>With Lovelace we’ve built a foundation that not only provides a lean and sleek interface, but will also allow us to add many new exciting features in the future. The main difference with the old UI is that we no longer store any UI concerns in the state machine.</p>
<p>When Home Assistant was started, I came up with an algorithm that would automatically organize the available entities in badges, cards and tabs; and then show that on the screen. Users demanded more influence; so over time, we’ve added a bunch of components and features of the backend whose main or sole purpose were to influence how the algorithm in the UI shows and organizes entities.</p>
<p>As this kept growing, I realized that we were on the wrong path. It was impossible to get an algorithm that would fulfill all needs and the backend shouldn’t be aware of anything in the frontend. It should just deliver the entities and the frontend should figure out how to display things together with the user.</p>
<p>At the same time as this was happening, we also had some discussions about the development of the frontend. Users wanted more control on what is shown, when it’s shown and how it’s shown. Eventually, <a href="https://github.com/andrey-git">@andrey-git</a> came up with Custom UI for the old interface. This allowed users to do whatever they wanted. However, it was limited to power users.</p>
<p>Lovelace was built <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/issues/14">from the start</a> to tackle these problems. The initial version completely dropped the algorithm and required users to add each card to their configuration. We went from a fully automatic UI to nothing. We launched it under the nomer “experimental UI” and it quickly gained traction. People loved the control and the ability to inject custom cards or entity rows at will.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm was great among our power users, however by switching away from an automatic UI, we were no longer beginner-friendly. A new user would open Home Assistant and they would see a blank, unconfigured UI. We realized that this had to be solved if we were to make Lovelace the default.</p>
<p>To solve this, we re-introduced our automatic algorithm. However, this time the algorithm generates a Lovelace configuration. If a user doesn’t like the automatic configuration, they can take control and configure it to their liking. When you take control, the automatic generated configuration will no longer be updated by Home Assistant, allowing the user to change each detail.</p>
<p>To make configuring your UI as easy as possible, Lovelace UI allows (custom) cards to include a config editor. This way the user will be able to quickly edit a card while a live preview shows how the changes look. If a card does not include an editor (yet), the user will be presented with a text editor in the browser.</p>
<p>Because of the ease to customize and share customizations, we’ve already seen a big community get created around Lovelace. They are very active in the #lovelace channel on <a href="/join-chat/">our chat</a>, and work is shared on <a href="https://sharethelove.io/">ShareTheLove.io</a> and the <a href="https://www.awesome-ha.com/#lovelace-ui">Lovelace section on Awesome HA</a>.</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>Lovelace UI has been 8 months in the making and it has been a big undertaking. We’ve worked hard and are proud of being able to ship this first version. Lovelace UI would not have been possible without the following current and former members of the Lovelace team:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/balloob">@balloob</a> / Paulus Schoutsen</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bramkragten">@bramkragten</a> / Bram Kragten</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/c727">@c727</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ciotlosm">@ciotlosm</a> / Marius Ciotloș</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/iantrich">@iantrich</a> / Ian Richardson</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeradM">@jeradM</a> / Jerad Meisner</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/thomasloven">@thomasloven</a> / Thomas Lovén</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zsarnett">@zsarnett</a> / Zack Arnett</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to thank the community for adopting this so eagerly, building a ton of helpful tooling and examples and helping one another to create beautiful UIs for their homes.</p>
<h2>Old UI</h2>
<p>The transition to Lovelace should be painless for most users. If you are encountering issues, please <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer/issues">let us know</a>. For the time being, you will be able to still change back to the old user interface on a per-device basis by going to the info developer tool and following the instructions.</p>

    <link href="https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2018/06/22/release-72/"/>
    <updated>2018-06-22T00:01:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2018/06/22/release-72</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am super excited about this release as it brings some great examples of how we are refining the system to become more customizable and, at the same time, user friendly. The first thing that I am really excited about is a new experimental user interface that we call Lovelace. Check <a href="https://gist.github.com/ciotlosm/9508388876edf92c4c1f3579e740fbd5">this awesome rundown</a> of all the features by <a href="https://github.com/ciotlosm">@ciotlosm</a>. The TL;DR: a faster, more customizable and more extensible UI with the same look and feel as the old one.</p>
<p>Be aware, this <em>is</em> experimental, so things will change. However, we felt like we didn’t want to keep this away from you any longer. Check the <a href="/lovelace">Lovelace UI docs</a> on how to get started. Make sure to share your creations!</p>
<p>Thanks to all the people that have been hanging out in the #beta channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/c5DvZ4e">Discord</a> helping development, finding and squashing bugs and making suggestions. Especially thanks to <a href="https://github.com/c727">@c727</a> for all his development work and <a href="https://github.com/arsaboo">@arsaboo</a> for being the first guinea pig.</p>

</p>
<p>Another change is that Nest, Sonos and Cast will now have to be configured using a config entry. Config entries can be created via the integrations page in the config panel. This is a concept that we have been developing for a couple of months now and it’s our goal to eventually use this as the way to configure all components.</p>

</p>
<p>And as if this releases even needs more cool stuff, the Insteon integration now supports X10 thanks to <a href="https://github.com/teharris1">@teharris1</a>. It was a frequent requested feature from the Insteon community.</p>
<p>And finally, we’ll be extending the open beta for Home Assistant Cloud until the first of September.</p>
<p>Enjoy this release and have a good weekend all!</p>
