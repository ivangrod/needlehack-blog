<p>Bruno here once again to bring you a bunch of news on your favorite iOS App üòâ. In this release, we are introducing some new features to complement the release of iOS 18, along with a new way to configure your Home Assistant Apple Watch app.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Dark and tinted app icons</h2>
<p>Within the iOS update rolling out today, Apple has introduced home screen customization for app icons. This includes a new dark mode variant and a tinted option where the user can choose an accent color for the icon. Of course Home Assistant joined the party.</p>
<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2024-09-16/new-icons.png' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Dark and tinted variants are available for the main App Icon and some custom icons">Dark and tinted variants are available for the main App Icon and some custom icons</p>
<h2>Control Center</h2>
<p>The new iOS also brings a new level of customization to Control Center, for which we are introducing five new controls: Assist, Toggle light, Run script, Activate scene, and Open page.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-09-16/control-center.jpg" alt="iOS 18 Control center options" /></p>
<p>With these options, you can use Home Assistant capabilities even faster, from asking Assist a question to running a complete script flow.</p>
<p>These controls are also available to be used with the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro and 16 series. In the <a href="/blog/2024/05/22/companion-app-for-ios-20245-assist/">previous release blog</a>, we discussed that this was a great way to access Assist, in a very similar way to how you trigger Siri with the power button. Well, this release speeds this up significantly by no longer using shortcuts. Just check out the difference.</p>
<p class='img'><lite-youtube videoid="v7NXQJMUK2c" videotitle="Comparing Assist launch from Shortcuts and iOS 18 Control"></lite-youtube>Assist opening on iOS 18 control (right) compared to from shortcuts (left)</p>
<h2>New Apple Watch configuration</h2>
<p>For a long time, our Watch app was only able to display <a href="https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/core/actions/">Home Assistant‚Äôs built-in iOS Actions</a>. With this release, you will be able to display scripts, scenes, iOS Actions, and more to come in the future. After updating, open the iOS App and go to companion app settings to find a new Apple Watch configuration screen where you can choose which items to display, their order, and customize the look.</p>
<p>A really useful customization is the <strong>Require confirmation</strong> option, which will prompt you with a confirmation popup before running the item. This will be very helpful if you, like me, have bad aim and accidentally open your garage door instead of turning on your TV.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-09-16/watch.png" alt="New Apple Watch configuration" /></p>
<h2>Other noteworthy changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre introducing new sensors, including Apple Watch battery level and state, app version, and location permission category.</li>
<li>A new Scripts home screen widget.</li>
<li>We‚Äôre working on adding Assist to the Apple Watch, try it out today, but be aware it‚Äôs still in beta.</li>
<li>Several bug fixes are included in this version,
<ul>
<li>Preventing widgets not working on iOS 15/16.</li>
<li>Allowing Watch LTE to run actions while far away from your iPhone (requires location permissions being enabled).</li>
<li>Fixing the black status bar when running older versions of Core.</li>
<li>Addressing gauge and details lock screen widgets crashing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <link href="https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2024/05/22/companion-app-for-ios-20245-assist/"/>
    <updated>2024-05-22T00:00:02+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2024/05/22/companion-app-for-ios-20245-assist</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey, this is Bruno. It has been a great few months since I joined Nabu Casa to work full-time on the Home Assistant iOS app, again a big thanks to our Home Assistant Cloud subscribers for making this possible. Today, I would like to recap what has been introduced since <a href="/blog/2024/01/29/companion-app-for-ios-20241-carplay/">the last blog post for version 2024.1</a> and discuss more about how Assist is being integrated into the Apple ecosystem - along with a number of other improvements to the app.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-05-ios-assist/ios-og.jpg" alt="Companion App for iOS 2024.5" /></p>
<!--more-->
<h2>Assist on iOS</h2>
<p>I am very happy to bring Assist for iOS with a new native UI, integrated with iOS shortcuts and widgets, so let‚Äôs start with a quick demo:</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="AW_eslcO6AU" videotitle="Assist in Companion App for iOS"></lite-youtube></p>
<p>In this demo, you see Assist being triggered from the iPhone 15 Pro ‚Äúaction button‚Äù and lock screen widget. Those are a few ways of interacting with Assist, but as it‚Äôs an iOS shortcut, you can trigger it in all sorts of creative ways. You can create an automation triggered by scanning an NFC tag that launches Assist, or even add it to an existing shortcut you already use.</p>
<h3>‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt have an iPhone 15 pro to use the action button?‚Äù</h3>
<p>It would be ideal if we could replace Siri with Assist in the power button long press, but since Apple doesn‚Äôt allow that. The second best option becomes the action button. For iPhones without it, there is a third option, the accessibility feature called ‚Äúback tap‚Äù. Follow <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/apd897693606/ios">this guide on the Apple page</a> to learn how to configure it.</p>
<h3>Widgets</h3>
<p>If back tap doesn‚Äôt work for you, Assist can be activated via our widgets from the home screen or with our very first iOS lock screen widget, which looks great:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-05-ios-assist/widgets.png" alt="Assist Widgets" /></p>
<h3>Accessibility feature alternative</h3>
<p>There is ‚Äúone more thing‚Äù that you can use to launch Assist, iOS has an accessibility feature called ‚ÄúVoice Control‚Äù which allows a user to basically navigate an iPhone completely using voice commands. On top of that they allow you to add ‚Äúcustom commands‚Äù so‚Ä¶ Yes! You can just add ‚ÄúOk Nabu‚Äù, then use the option <strong>Run shortcut</strong> and have it trigger ‚ÄúAssist In App‚Äù.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to take into consideration. I tried this last weekend, and although it‚Äôs pretty cool, it‚Äôs not as fast as calling Siri. You will also have full voice control enabled, so you trigger other commands every once in a while.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="ovFqaIiefuo" videotitle="Assist in iOS using accessibility voice control"></lite-youtube></p>
<h2>Other highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We have introduced the ability to run your Action widgets in the background, so you can quickly trigger them instead of having to wait for the app to launch to see the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This version introduced a simple way to create an automation for your iOS Action: simply tap on the ‚Äúcreate automation‚Äù button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We started improving our widgets‚Äô performance and capabilities. I know you all have great ideas, and I am currently working on the foundation to allow those to happen, but please continue sending feature requests to our Home Assistant Community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we first released CarPlay integration, we missed out on displaying all areas due to a limitation in the number of items allowed on a list. Since 2024.2, we have worked around this by using the first and last rows of the areas list as pagination arrows, so you can now see all your rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Actions UI in CarPlay was aligned to display the same information as in Apple Watch, previously we were displaying the ‚ÄúIdentifier‚Äù and ‚ÄùText‚Äù, now we display just the ‚ÄúText‚Äù so we keep consistency between platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also added a button to reload your widgets, since sometimes they may become blank for a few users after an update. For actions, we added a button to update server-created Actions manually, so you don‚Äôt need to reopen the app for that (but remember to restart HA after adding or removing Actions from YAML).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Memory usage and performance issues on our macOS client are big topics in our GitHub right now, and we are aware of them and are working towards improving them. As this release is the first iteration in that direction, we would like your feedback since this issue is not easily reproducible in all instances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before wrapping up, I would like to say how important reporting issues on GitHub is for the development of these companion apps. We are addressing them as fast as we can and with the attention necessary to make sure your problems are resolved. I would also like to take this opportunity to invite iOS devs (aspiring or established) who wish to contribute to jump in. Drop me a message so we can work together and move faster, I will be happy to help you get started.</p>

    <link href="https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2024/01/29/companion-app-for-ios-20241-carplay/"/>
    <updated>2024-01-29T00:00:02+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2024/01/29/companion-app-for-ios-20241-carplay</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey, this is Bruno. I have recently joined Nabu Casa to work full-time on the Home Assistant iOS app (thanks Home Assistant Cloud subscribers!). Today I have big news: Home Assistant is now available on Apple CarPlay! The release is rolling out and should be hitting your iOS devices soon (version 2024.1).</p>
<p>CarPlay support now gives Home Assistant users easy access to their devices and areas and the ability to create custom actions. Custom actions allow users to create advanced action sequences like unlocking the front door and turning on the porch lights. And all of this works across the multiple Home Assistant servers that you have configured in the app.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="u__oD7OhdJI" videotitle="Carplay is here!"></lite-youtube></p>
<p><img src="/needlehack-blog/images/blog/2024-01-ios-carplay/dxspark.png" style="border:none; box-shadow: none; float: right;" height="50"> Big thanks to DXspark for helping us make the foundation of CarPlay and kicking off the project.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2>CarPlay features</h2>
<p>The app is divided into four tabs to easily access the different functionality. We‚Äôve followed Apple‚Äôs guidelines to give the user a familiar experience that they know from other CarPlay apps.</p>
<p>You don‚Äôt have to configure the CarPlay app separately. It will automatically pick up your Home Assistant servers as configured in your app.</p>
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>Actions are a concept in the Home Assistant iOS app that allows you to execute automation in Home Assistant. This means that you can execute any automation you want, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚ÄúOpen the garage and start heating my home to 22 degrees Celsius‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúClose the garage and announce in the kitchen that I arrived‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúTurn the front yard lights on and unlock the front door‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<p>These actions have been available in the Home Assistant for Apple Watch app and can be called from the Home Assistant widgets. With today‚Äôs release, you can also easily trigger them from your CarPlay dashboard. This is the feature that has already become part of my daily routine.</p>
<p>If you haven‚Äôt created an Action yet, the CarPlay App can send a notification to your phone to guide you to get started.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-01-ios-carplay/firstaction.png" alt="Create your first CarPlay Action" />
<img src="/images/blog/2024-01-ios-carplay/actions.png" alt="CarPlay Actions" /></p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>The controls tab will group your devices and entities by their domain. We have started small and included the most useful domains first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Button</li>
<li>Cover</li>
<li>Input boolean</li>
<li>Input button</li>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Lock</li>
<li>Scene</li>
<li>Script</li>
<li>Switch</li>
</ul>
<p>For these domains, you can toggle lights and switches, activate buttons, script, scene actions, and of course, toggle your garage door or gate.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-01-ios-carplay/controls.png" alt="Create your first CarPlay Action" /></p>
<h2>Areas</h2>
<p>The areas tab allows you to find your devices and entities based on their area. Quickly scroll through an area to see the current states and toggle devices.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-01-ios-carplay/areas.png" alt="CarPlay Areas" /></p>
<h2>Servers</h2>
<p>When you‚Äôre driving to your parents, you might want to be able to notify them or open their garage door as you arrive. With the ‚ÄúServers‚Äù tab, you will be able to quickly change and control a different Home Assistant server.</p>
<p>This feature builds upon the multiple server support that has been part of the Home Assistant iOS app for a couple of years now.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2024-01-ios-carplay/servers.png" alt="CarPlay Servers" /></p>
<p>I hope you will enjoy using Home Assistant on CarPlay. Please let us know what else you would like to see available for CarPlay!</p>
<h2>Release notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The app is now available for iOS 15+</li>
<li>CarPlay support was added for iOS 16+</li>
<li>The Bulgarian language was added</li>
<li>Improvements for iOS Actions so they‚Äôre easier to use</li>
<li>In macOS, the window size will be restored when you open the app again</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2023-12-27T00:00:02+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2023/12/27/companion-app-for-ios-202312-lets-go</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have good news for those hoping for more features and faster development of the iOS Companion App! I, Bruno Pantale√£o, have joined Nabu Casa as an iOS engineer (of course, also working on watchOS, iPadOS, and macOS apps), and am planning to continue the great work done by Robbie Trencheny, Zac West, and the community, giving the iOS app the attention that it deserves. So let‚Äôs talk about this month‚Äôs 2023.12 release of the app!</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2023-12-ios-lets-go/ios-og.png" alt="Companion App for iOS 2023.12" /></p>

<h2>Apple Thread network credentials sharing</h2>
<p>If you have HomePods or Apple TVs and you also have a Thread border router in Home Assistant, you may want to take advantage of Apple‚Äôs network to control devices in your home. You can now import your Apple Thread credentials into Home Assistant and then make Apple the preferred Thread network.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2023-12-ios-lets-go/1.png" alt="Apple Thread network credentials sharing" /></p>
<h2>New watchOS App Icon</h2>
<p>We updated the Apple Watch App Icon with the new Home Assistant logo.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2023-12-ios-lets-go/2.png" alt="New watchOS App Icon" /></p>
<h2>Toggle all scenes for watchOS</h2>
<p>Previously, you would have to disable scenes one by one to hide them on your Apple Watch. If you, like me, have a Philips Hue bridge, you would probably see several auto-generated scenes (like ‚ÄòBathroom concentrate‚Äô and ‚ÄòBathroom Arctic aurora‚Äô below :D ) that are not always relevant to see on your watch. We added a button to quickly toggle between all scenes now in the iOS companion app.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2023-12-ios-lets-go/3.png" alt="Toggle all scenes for watchOS" /></p>
<h2>Keep up with ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs new‚Äù in the App</h2>
<p>We have added a <strong>What‚Äôs new?</strong> link in companion App settings so you can quickly access the latest App release notes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2023-12-ios-lets-go/4.jpeg" alt="Keep up with Whats new in the App" /></p>
<h2>Support for iOS 12, 13, and 14 in 2024.01</h2>
<p>In the new year, we will do some housecleaning to make sure that the iOS Companion App is prepared for the future. To do so, we will stop supporting iOS 12, 13, and 14 in release 2024.01 of the Companion App. We know our users are repurposing older phones and tablets into dashboards and controls for their homes, which aligns with our focus on sustainability. It‚Äôs why we try to keep our apps running on older devices for as long as we can.</p>
<p>Currently, less than 1% of our users (according to the App Store analytics provided by users who gave permission to share their data with Apple) are still on these three iOS versions. Supporting them makes the codebase hard to maintain and blocks us from using newer iOS features. This change will make it easier for new contributors to feel comfortable contributing to the iOS codebase, which is also one of my goals. With a more modern codebase, we can give more attention to PRs and help other contributors have everything they need to feel comfortable submitting PRs.</p>
<p>This does not mean your iOS 12, 13, or 14 devices have become unusable. You can still access your Home Assistant using the browser if you have a device that can‚Äôt update past iOS 12, such as the 2014 iPhone 6 or iPad Mini 3. All other devices currently capable of running iOS 13 or 14 can be updated to iOS 15 or higher and use the new versions of the iOS Companion App.</p>
<h2>On the roadmap</h2>
<p>Wondering what we have on the roadmap for our Apple apps? We‚Äôre still working on it, but you can expect further developments to make Home Assistant on the Apple ecosystem more integrated, bringing shared features between iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac - and I‚Äôm looking forward to getting my hands on Apple Vision Pro and seeing the possibilities it brings to the Open Home. We‚Äôre also planning on improvements to Siri shortcuts widgets and as many new sensors as possible. Another feature that is on our radar is Assist; in 2023, we completed the Year of the Voice. Android users benefitted from some extra functions compared to iOS users, and we want to make sure we catch up and bring these features to iPhones as well!</p>
