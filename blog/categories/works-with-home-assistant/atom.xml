We’re making new frients this week, and they’re bringing an extensive line of Zigbee devices to our [Works With Home Assistant program](https://works-with.home-assistant.io/). Each device is tested by our team, ensuring they provide the best experience possible for Home Assistant. [Frient](https://www.frient.com/) is widely available across Europe, and are well-known for their sleek, unobtrusive designs that its customers love for their high Home Approval Factor.<!--more-->

## Our newest frient

Based in Denmark, the frient brand was developed by Onics, (formerly Develco Products), and they have years of experience with Zigbee devices. Frient is bringing its proven technology to the Works With Home Assistant program, as well as their Danish design that easily blends into almost any home.

Recent Works With partners have brought Z-Wave, Matter, and even Bluetooth devices to Home Assistant, but it's been _a couple of years_ 😅 since Zigbee-specific devices have joined the program. Zigbee is one of the most popular open protocols that is used with Home Assistant, with hundreds of thousands of users making use of it today. It's a proven technology that connects directly to Home Assistant, no cloud or Wi-Fi connection required. Zigbee is a mesh protocol, where some devices act as repeaters, strengthening the network as more are added. It was built from the ground up to power the smart home, and has been optimized to give devices really long (sometimes multi-year) battery life.

<div class="alert">
<p>"Joining the Works With Home Assistant program is a proud milestone for frient. It reflects our strong commitment to open, user-centric smart home experiences and ensures that our products seamlessly integrate with one of the most trusted platforms in the market. For Home Assistant users, it means more choice and flexibility — and for frient, it strengthens our position as a key player in the connected smart home space."</p>
<em style="text-align: right; display: block;">- Martin Langballe, International Business Development Manager at frient</em>
</div>

All you need to get started with Zigbee in Home Assistant is a Zigbee adapter or ‘stick’, such as the [Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1](/connectzbt1/) (wow, we released this in 2022, I wonder when we’re finally going to build a successor? 😉). By plugging the adapter into a USB port on your Home Assistant system, it should then discover the device and add the [ZHA integration](/integrations/frient/). After that is set up, you can start adding devices to your Zigbee network.  We’ve even added in a cool [new visualization](/blog/2025/06/11/release-20256/#making-sense-of-bluetooth) so that you can see how your Zigbee devices interact with each other.

ZHA is built with the support of the Open Home Foundation, and it even has a full-time developer ([@puddly](https://github.com/puddly)) dedicated to improving it and helping certify new Works With partner devices. Your support makes this possible, whether through a Home Assistant Cloud subscription or by purchasing official hardware.

## Devices

<p class="img">

When your energy company won’t provide your raw usage data, there’s always another way 😉
</p>

In case you didn’t know, Works With Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box with Home Assistant. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works With Home Assistant is operated by the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/), and the support of [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) subscribers funds this work.

Our team has worked extensively with frient to ensure that the following items work seamlessly with Home Assistant.

- [frient Motion Sensor Pro](https://www.frient.com/products/motion-sensor-pro)

- [frient IO Module](https://www.frient.com/products/io-module)

- [frient Smart Plug Mini](https://www.frient.com/products/smart-plug-mini)

- [frient Entry Sensor 2 Pro](https://www.frient.com/products/entry-sensor-2-pro)

- [frient Smart Siren UK](https://www.frient.com/products/smart-siren)

- [frient Smart Siren EU](https://www.frient.com/products/smart-siren)

- [frient Intelligent Keypad](https://www.frient.com/products/intelligent-keypad)

- [frient Water Leak Detector](https://www.frient.com/products/water-leak-detector)

- [frient Smart Button](https://www.frient.com/products/smart-button)

- [frient Intelligent Smoke Alarm](https://www.frient.com/products/intelligent-smoke-alarm)

- [frient Air Quality Sensor](https://www.frient.com/products/air-quality-sensor)

- [frient Smart Humidity Sensor](https://www.frient.com/products/smart-humidity-sensor)

- [frient Electricity Meter Interface 2 LED](https://www.frient.com/products/electricity-meter-interface-2-led)

This is a big portion of frient’s product line, and provides energy monitoring, device control, safety, and security sensors. The frient IO Module is the first certified Zigbee module that can be used to turn low-voltage dumb devices like electric blinds or garage doors into devices that can be controlled by Home Assistant.

There are some great devices here for building a more sustainable smart home. The Electricity Meter Interface 2 LED allows you to get the data off your energy meter and record it into Home Assistant. Another win for sustainability is their use of AA and AAA batteries wherever practical, meaning you can use rechargeables instead of constantly buying and recycling coin cells.

I also selfishly love to see some great UK-specific devices being brought into the program with the frient Smart Siren having both UK and EU versions.

## Best frients forever

It’s great to see Zigbee get some high-quality certified Works With Home Assistant devices after a multi-year wait. Frient has put a good deal of work into this launch and are big fans of our work and the community. There are more exciting Zigbee developments to come, so stay tuned!

## FAQs

**Q: If I have a device that is not listed under “Works With Home Assistant” does this mean it’s not supported?**

A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function perfectly well but be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program.

**Q: Ok, so what’s the point of the Works With program?**

A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have full functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud, and will continue to do so long-term.

**Q: How were these devices tested?**

A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard HA Green Hub with the ZBT-1 and with the ZHA integration. We haven’t tested these devices with Zigbee2MQTT, so we would recommend checking their [device compatibility documentation](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/#v=Frient). If you have another hub, Zigbee adapter, or integration, that’s not a problem, but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.

**Q: Will you be adding more frient devices to the program?**

A: Why not! We’re thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at frient to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here.

    <link href="https://ivangrod.github.io/needlehack-blog/blog/2025/08/21/airgradient-joins-works-with-home-assistant/"/>
    <updated>2025-08-21T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/needlehack-blog/blog/2025/08/21/airgradient-joins-works-with-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-airgradient/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="AirGradient joins Works with Home Assistant">

We're excited to announce that [AirGradient](https://www.airgradient.com/) is the latest manufacturer to join the fast-growing [Works With Home Assistant](https://works-with.home-assistant.io/) program! They bring their air quality monitors to the program, with both indoor and outdoor models.

AirGradient is the first partner in the program focused on building advanced indoor and outdoor air quality monitors. They are also well known within our community for their powerful tech, and for their focus on open source and dedication to local air quality projects around the world.

<!--more-->

## A breath of fresh air

AirGradient is the first partner to join that operates out of Thailand, and they initially started making their air monitors to help their local community. They actively support air quality improvement projects both in Thailand itself, but also globally. AirGradient donates monitors and has partnered with a variety of different organisations and NGOs, including [UNICEF](https://www.airgradient.com/blog/open-source-to-change-the-world/). These monitors are often placed in schools, helping young people to better understand and work to protect their air quality.

<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-08-airgradient/outdoors.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="An Open Air Monitor mounted outdoors in Vietnam">An Open Air Monitor in Vietnam</p>

Community is central to our work with AirGradient. Their hardware and software are open source, just like our own. Plus, they’ve taken an active role in integrating into Home Assistant, bringing [their local Wi-Fi integration](/integrations/airgradient/) up to not just the gold, but the platinum tier on our [integration quality scale.](/docs/quality_scale/) Like all of our _Works With_ partners, the devices work completely locally with no need for a cloud connection. What’s more, they really embrace the DIY aspect of the smart home, with their devices available fully assembled or as a build-it-yourself kit!

AirGradient’s open approach even extends to the data collected by their community of users. Whilst completely optional, users can share their air quality readings with the world (which they [visualize into an amazing map](https://www.airgradient.com/map/?zoom=1\&lat=49.2125578\&long=16.62662018\&org=ag\&meas=rco2)). This helpful air quality map grows every time a user opts to share their data, and is a fantastic open resource for climate researchers, students, or anyone concerned about air quality in their local area. If your area is a blank spot on this map, that is all the more reason to buy an AirGradient outdoor monitor.

<img src='/images/blog/2025-08-airgradient/visual-map.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="An online AirGradient air quality map">

Each kit comes with a screwdriver and is designed for easy repair. Broken sensor? Swap it out. Firmware update needed? Flash it yourself. Sustainability is one of the core guiding principles of the Open Home Foundation, and we love that repairability is built in. AirGradient also donates at least 1% of annual sales to non-profits and community direct donations. In fact, they asked us to include in this blog an open invitation to our community: If you have a local project that you think would benefit from open source air quality monitors, get in touch through [this link](https://www.airgradient.com/support/).

<div class="alert">
    <p>"We're excited to join the Works With Home Assistant program because it aligns perfectly with our open-source philosophy. Home Assistant represents the same values we believe in - local control, privacy, and community-driven innovation. Together, we're proving that open systems don't just work better for users, they create better outcomes for the planet."</p>
<em style="text-align: right; display: block;">- Achim Haug, Founder and CEO of AirGradient</em>

## Certified Devices

In case you’re new to [Works With Home Assistant](https://works-with.home-assistant.io/), unlike some certification programs, it’s not just a badge. We rigorously test items in-house and provide feedback to the manufacturers to ensure that products work easily out of the box and provide a seamless experience. The Works With program is operated by the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/) and funded by the support of [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) Subscribers.

AirGradient has certified the following devices with us:  

- [AirGradient One - Indoor Air Quality Monitor](https://www.airgradient.com/indoor/)

- [AirGradient Open Air - Outdoor Air Quality Monitor](https://www.airgradient.com/outdoor/)

<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-08-airgradient/kitchen-counter.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="An AirGradient One sitting on a kitchen counter">Finally, a metric to show precisely how badly you burned your dinner</p>

When we talk about sustainability in relation to the smart home, it’s easy to focus on energy management and reducing our carbon impact. However, with AirGradient, you can deep dive into the impacts of the release of CO2 and other air pollutants, better understanding what you, your family, and friends breathe in every day. With an in-house science team of atmospheric chemists and public health experts, they ensure that the monitors are accurate and each of the fully assembled monitors are tested in a dedicated test chamber.

Whether you want to see if your new furniture is putting dangerous VOCs into the air, or if a smelly candle is going to aggravate any allergies, the use cases are endless. The AirGradient One also has a built-in display with both detailed data and a set of LEDs to show general air quality at a glance. Both devices measure carbon dioxide, VOCs, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, temperature, and humidity. AirGradient also provides helpful documentation on their website that helps you understand these measurements and the impact they can have on your household.

These devices can not only give you in-depth information about the air in and out of your home, but they can also unlock powerful automations. We often see these devices paired with door or window open/close sensors, air purifiers, dehumidifiers, or air conditioners to reduce particulates in the home from pets or carpets.

## Clearing the air

We’re so excited to be partnered with AirGradient. Their mission is important, and their open and sustainable approach is precisely what we love to see. Partnerships like this are only possible with the support of [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) subscribers. Many of us at the Open Home Foundation have picked up AirGradient monitors and are sharing our air quality data today, and we’d love for you to join us on the map!

    <link href="https://ivangrod.github.io/needlehack-blog/blog/2025/07/29/shelly-joins-works-with-home-assistant/"/>
    <updated>2025-07-29T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/needlehack-blog/blog/2025/07/29/shelly-joins-works-with-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-07-shelly/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Shelly joins Works with Home Assistant">

We’re excited to welcome [Shelly](https://www.shelly.com/) to the [Works with Home Assistant](https://works-with.home-assistant.io/) program! Shelly is very well-established in both our ecosystem and the smart home world, so it’s great to formally certify a selection of their Z-Wave devices.

Their retrofit smart switches and relays are amazing for turning all sorts of _dumb_ devices, like light fixtures or ceiling fans, into devices you can easily control in _smart_ new ways. Also, being Works with certified means they have been thoroughly tested, ensuring they give the best possible experience with Home Assistant.

The variety of complex settings and functionality, like energy monitoring, makes them popular with our community doing advanced smart retrofits, like connecting an old garage door or motorized shutters. These are perfect for keeping non-smart devices out of the landfill and working for years to come.
<!--more-->

## From A to Z-Wave

Shelly, originally launched in Bulgaria in 2017, has been a mainstay in our community for some years. They became known initially for their WiFi smart switches and relays that could be easily used locally, but now offer a wide range of smart devices and ways to connect them. For this first round of Works with Home Assistant certified products, the focus is firmly on the [Z-Wave](/integrations/zwave_js/) lines.

 If you’re not familiar with Z-Wave, it’s a well-established low-powered wireless technology designed with the smart home in mind. It uses an entirely different bit of radio spectrum than WiFi, meaning it has less chance of experiencing interference. This spectrum makes it better at getting through thick walls and communicating over longer distances — with the recent [Long Range](https://z-wavealliance.org/what-is-z-wave-long-range-how-does-it-differ-from-z-wave/) iteration of the standard, they can [communicate even further](/blog/2024/05/08/zwave-is-not-dead/#range-testing-our-z-wave-stick-prototype).

Given our focus on local control, items that work on Z-Wave are ideal if you want to avoid the cloud. Home Assistant will act as your Z-Wave controller using the [Z-Wave JS add-on](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-zwave-js-ui) (another awesome Open Home Foundation project). So, all you need is a Z-Wave adapter to use alongside these devices. _If you haven’t purchased one yet, you might want to wait before hitting that buy button_ 😉.

Shelly shares our focus on interoperability, with items using a variety of protocols, while being available worldwide. These items are also super helpful for the energy-conscious. They have low power consumption, power metering, and can easily blend in with your current home decor, as they sit in the wall behind your existing switches.

<p class='img'><img src='/images/blog/2025-07-shelly/pm-mini.webp' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Shelly Wave PM Mini in hand showing small size">Mini? This thing is microscopic!</p>

## Getting Involved

We’ve been lucky enough to meet the Shelly team on several occasions, and they were kind enough to showcase [how the Las Vegas Mob Museum uses Shelly and Home Assistant](https://www.youtube.com/live/o4Vctz1_KYE?t=6897s) during our annual ‘State of the Open Home’ event. In May, they went one step further and hosted one of our [Community Days](/blog/2025/06/24/community-day-2025-wrap-up/) in South Florida. It’s really exciting to see that partners who join the ‘Works with’ program don’t just see it as a badge to stick on a box, but a real chance to engage with, and contribute to, this amazing community.

<div class="alert">
    <p>"Many of our users already rely on Home Assistant to power their smart homes, and we’ve seen firsthand how important local control, privacy, and flexibility are to them. By joining the <i>Works with Home Assistant</i> program, we’re reinforcing our commitment to open, reliable smart home solutions. With the upcoming launch of our <strong>Shelly Wave Long Range</strong> devices—offering wireless coverage of up to <strong>1 kilometer</strong> — we’re pushing the boundaries of what smart home technology can do. Combined with Home Assistant’s powerful platform, this will be a <strong>market-leading solution</strong>, capable of covering <strong>use cases no other ecosystem today can reach</strong>. Together, we’re building the future of smart homes: open, powerful, and ready for real-world demands."</p>
<em style="text-align: right; display: block;">- Leon Kralj, CTO at Shelly</em>

## Devices

In case you didn’t know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/), and the support of [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) subscribers funds this work.

**What devices have been certified?**

- [Shelly Wave PM Mini](https://www.shelly.com/products/shelly-qubino-wave-pm-mini)

- [Shelly Wave i4](https://www.shelly.com/products/shelly-qubino-wave-i4)

- [Shelly Wave 1PM Mini](https://www.shelly.com/products/shelly-qubino-wave-1pm-mini)

- [Shelly Wave 2PM](https://www.shelly.com/products/shelly-qubino-wave-2pm)

- [Shelly Wave Pro 1PM](https://www.shelly.com/products/shelly-wave-pro-1-pm)

Whilst the Shelly Wave Pro 1PM sits in an electrical box, the remaining devices sit behind a standard plug, switch or device. This means they are a super cost-effective way to retrofit devices, which in turn reduces e-waste. The Minis are very small (duh), and so should fit in most tight places around the home, even with low-profile installations. The Shelly Wave 1PM Mini is the world’s smallest Z-Wave smart switch. In some areas of the world, you may need professional installation by a qualified electrician, so be sure to check your region's regulations. If you’re a confident DIYer, Shelly has a lot of [helpful guides](https://kb.shelly.cloud/knowledge-base/installation-guides) on their site to walk you through installing it yourself.

## The first of many waves

These devices are the first from Shelly to join the program, but certainly won’t be the last, as we look forward to many exciting developments with Z-Wave Long Range. Keep your eyes peeled for our upcoming hardware announcement that will work perfectly with our Z-Wave partners.

Thanks again for your support (by subscribing to [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) and [buying official hardware](https://www.nabucasa.com/#:~:text=the%20first%20boot.-,Official%20Home%20Assistant%20hardware,-Get%20the%20best)), which allows the Open Home Foundation to build these partnerships and certify new devices to join Works with Home Assistant.

    <updated>2025-07-15T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/needlehack-blog/blog/2025/07/15/zooz-joins-works-with-home-assistant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-07-zooz/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Zooz joins Works with Home Assistant">

Our [Works with Home Assistant](https://works-with.home-assistant.io/) program is expanding once again, and this time we’re excited to announce Zooz is joining us! We have tested many new devices of all different types, ensuring they provide the best experience possible with Home Assistant. As well as classic staples for the smart home, they also bring some very cool flood protection devices to help safeguard your home.

These will be the first certified [Z-Wave](/integrations/zwave_js/) devices added to the program in some time, and are just part of the exciting future the Home Assistant community and Zooz see for this smart home protocol.<!--more-->

## Zooz zooms in

Zooz started out not as a manufacturer, but as a retailer of smart devices. They focused so much on customer support that they soon realized they could do a better job than manufacturers already in the market, and so turned instead to creating their own products. They focus on Z-Wave for its interoperability and security, and they include easy-to-understand installation guides with these devices. They also have a wide knowledge base on their website and a very responsive support team.

As Z-Wave experts, they’re members of the Z-Wave Alliance (where [Paulus is also a member](/blog/2024/09/24/we-are-joining-the-z-wave-alliance-board/) as the voice of the open source community). While Zooz is based in the USA, many of their products are available worldwide.

## It takes Zooz

Zooz has really embraced the Home Assistant community. Agnes, their VP of Brand and Partnership Support, recently spoke to the team over at the Home Assistant podcast about their startup journey. She also came along to our Community Day in Brooklyn, hosted by our very own Product Lead, [Madelena](https://github.com/madelena). It’s awesome to see manufacturers get out and connect with our community members.

<lite-youtube videoid="dobq10nGoS0" videotitle="The evolution of Zooz with Agnes Lorenz | Home Assistant Podcast"></lite-youtube>

<div class="alert">
    <p>"Zooz has been contributing quality hardware to the smart home community for over 10 years now and our biggest takeaway is that thoughtful integration is key for our customers. We recognize that our devices are part of an ecosystem and that's why we are so excited to partner with Home Assistant, a platform we highly respect for its commitment to making products work together seamlessly. I especially appreciate how quickly Home Assistant embraced Z-Wave Long Range and how easy it is to set up Z-Wave on a brand new system thanks to hardware like Home Assistant Green. We look forward to connecting with the Home Assistant community, learning together, and creating new devices driven by your feedback."</p>

## Frequencies and firmware

If you’re based in North America, all new devices will come with Z-Wave Long Range (ZWLR) as standard. If you are based elsewhere, like in Europe, Long Range won’t be enabled quite yet. The reason is that even though the Z-Wave Long Range protocol has been available for some time in North America, it was only released in Europe in April 2025, as certification took a bit longer. The nice thing about Zooz’s North American 700 series and European 800 series Z-Wave, is that ZWLR can be enabled via an over-the-air (OTA) firmware update, so hopefully everyone will be taking part in the Z-Wave Long Range revolution soon. Watch this space for a not-so-secret Home Assistant Z-Wave hardware announcement coming your way…

Z-Wave Long Range opens up a whole new world of options and makes for an even more flexible smart home. Maybe you have a large backyard, or an awkwardly shaped long, but narrow home that is hard to get other protocols to cover adequately. Or perhaps you have devices that are just too far away for other protocols. A common example is wanting a way to get notified when the mailbox at the front of your driveway is opened or closed.

Many of the certified devices can function outdoors or be purchased with accessories to make them waterproof. Speaking on a personal note, we had a leak in our garage a year or so ago after some bad weather. Other protocols couldn’t reach that far, and we had no way to be notified. I cannot wait for an easy way to be notified across that bigger distance, and avoid all the unpleasant clean-up.

It’s great to read stories on social media or our forums where smart home devices have kicked in and saved the day, like getting that all-important notification or cutting off the water supply with something like Zooz’s valve actuator.

<lite-youtube videoid="7k8Vm-CVhmg" videotitle="Video of the valve actuator"></lite-youtube>

Z-Wave, like other open standards we support, works locally, and all of the devices listed above will work locally, without the need for any extra cloud connection or apps. Remember, if you’re also looking for remote access to make sure you don’t miss any critical notifications while you’re away from home, an easy way to get this set up is to subscribe to [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/). Not only will this help you monitor your smart home remotely, but you’ll also be supporting the development of Home Assistant.

## FAQs

**Q: If I have a device that is not listed under "Works with Home Assistant" does this mean it’s not supported?**

A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function perfectly well, but be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program.

**Q: OK, so what’s the point of the Works with program?**

A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have the expected functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud, and will continue to do so long-term.

**Q: How were these devices tested?**

A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard HA Green Hub with our Z-Wave Integration. If you have another hub integration that’s not a problem, but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.

**Q: Will you be adding more Zooz devices to the program?**

A: Absolutely! We’re thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at Zooz to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='/images/blog/2025-07-nuki/art.jpg' style='border: 0;box-shadow: none;' alt="Nuki Joins Works with Home Assistant">

We're thrilled to welcome [Nuki](https://nuki.io/) to the [Works with Home Assistant](https://works-with.home-assistant.io/) program! Nuki creates some slick-looking smart locks that you can fit to most doors (or even on top of existing locks). They are constantly pioneering new and exciting features, while also using the open standards we support. Nuki is today bringing three different lock types to the program, all certified by our team to provide the best experience possible with Home Assistant.<!--more-->

## Unlocking their origin

Nuki started just over 10 years ago, with their first smart lock that was called the 'magic black box'. It was this award-winning design that evolved into the sleek Nuki Smart Locks that are available today.  Keeping everything in the family, the brand was started by brothers Martin and Jürgen. Frustrated with the hassle of carrying a door key in their sports kit, the brothers launched a successful Kickstarter and have been innovating ever since. They design their smart locks in Austria and manufacture them in Europe. Their locks are available across Europe, and in early July, they launched the Nuki Smart Lock in the U.S.

Nuki devices are certified for use with the [Home Assistant Matter integration](/integrations/matter/), which is now [officially certified](/blog/2025/03/10/matter-certification/). Like all 'Works with' certified devices, Nuki locks prioritize local control, so you can manage your day-to-day home security without relying on a cloud connection.

<div class="alert">
    <p>"Joining the 'Works with Home Assistant' program is a logical step for us. We believe strongly in the power of open ecosystems and giving control to our customers. Home Assistant represents a vibrant community dedicated to innovation and customization, and we are thrilled to align our products with this vision. This integration ensures our customers can build the smart home they want, with the products they trust. The 'Works with Home Assistant' certification provides customers with the confidence that Nuki's products have been tested for compatibility and offer a smooth integration experience."</p>

## Devices

In case you didn't know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/), and the support of [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) subscribers funds this work.

Our team has been busy testing the Nuki locks for some time and has certified the following Matter-over-Thread enabled devices. It's important to note that to set up the lock, calibrate it, and activate Matter you will need to use the Nuki app. However, there is no hard requirement for a cloud account or account registration in order to use these locks. Once the device is active and connected via Matter, you can manage it purely through Home Assistant, and can even delete the app.

- [Nuki Smart Lock Ultra](https://nuki.io/en-uk/products/smart-lock-ultra)

## Insane speeds, literally

The devices certified include two cylindrical models, the Nuki Smart Lock Pro and the Nuki Smart Lock Ultra, which both feature a brushless motor and three speed settings. The speediest of these is called the 'Insane' setting. This ultra-fast setting is ideal for those in a hurry, but you can also pick from 'standard' or 'gentle' to move at a more leisurely pace. The gentle setting is also perfect for quieter unlocking, so you're not disturbing others if you're coming home after a night shift or an early morning jog.

We love that the cylindrical devices come with a rechargeable battery to reduce e-waste. Each cylindrical lock comes with both white and black band options, so you can match your existing hardware or your home's style. The Nuki Smart Lock Pro can retrofit over a current lock, whereas the Nuki Smart Lock Ultra comes with its own cylinder.

If you're looking for a solid entry-level choice instead, the Nuki Smart Lock Go is a great option, which uses four AA batteries. Both the Smart Lock Go and Smart Lock Pro can be installed in under five minutes, with no drilling or special tools required, which may mean even if you're renting you could install a smart lock. Works with Home Assistant is all about providing more choice to the community, and Nuki is expanding the smart lock offerings.

## A keyless future

All of the models listed work locally, as this is a requirement of the 'Works with' program so that you can ensure you feel safe and secure in your smart home. However, some users may wish to access these devices remotely too, allowing you to unlock the door for guests, contractors, family, or friends. If you're looking for remote access, this can either be provided by the Nuki App, or via your Home Assistant system with something like [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) (which supports the development of Home Assistant but also helps bring more 'Works with' partners to the program 🤝).

We're really excited to have Nuki join our certified devices, and see the use cases the community will come up with to integrate their smart locks into the rest of their smart home.

### FAQ ON WORKS WITH HOME ASSISTANT

***Q: If I have a device that is not listed under 'Works with Home Assistant' does this mean it's not supported?***

A: Most Nuki locks will work via Matter with Home Assistant and we have even tried out a couple of older locks with good results. However, we have only officially tested and certified the devices listed above. If there is any other device missing from this list it just means that it hasn't gone through testing with our team or doesn't fit the requirements of the program. It might function well, and may be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don't currently test under the program.

***Q: Ok, so what's the point of the Works with program?***

A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. We look for brands that will bring their key functionality into Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud logins, and continue to do so long-term.

***Q: How were these devices tested?***

A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard Home Assistant Yellow with the built-in Thread border router and our [certified Matter Integration](/integrations/matter/).  If you have another hub, border router setup, or integration, that's not a problem. We test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.

***Q: Will you be adding more Nuki devices to the program?***

A: All of the locks Nuki currently sells are now represented here in the 'Works with' program. We're thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at Nuki to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here.
