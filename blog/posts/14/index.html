<p>Happy October! October is always a special month for the project. It is the
month everybody starts working on their home automations again, the month that
Hacktoberfest brings in lots of new contributions and contributors to the
project (👋 welcome!), and also this year: <a href="/blog/2022/09/30/the-month-of-what-the-heck/">the Month of “What the Heck?!”</a>.</p>
<p>The Month of WTH already <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/what-the-heck/56">looks very promising</a>,
and many good and interesting issues, ideas, and suggestions to streamline
have been proposed. Keep those topics and votes going ❤️.</p>
<p>Oh! And Home Assistant Core 2022.10! 🎉</p>
<p>Last month’s release was a big one; this month’s release mostly continues to
improving on that. I guess it is no surprise that the biggest improvement can
be found (once again) in Bluetooth! There is a lot more, though this release
is a bit “all over the place”, which is actually kinda nice.</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>
<p>../Frenck</p>
<p>PS: I noticed the <a href="/skyconnect/">Home Assistant SkyConnect is now available for pre-order</a> 🥳</p>

    <p>Europe has entered an energy crisis and prices for electricity and gas are skyrocketing. Rates of €1/kWh and €3,40 per m³ of gas are not uncommon. People are turning to their friends in the Home Assistant community asking for help on how to save energy. With winter around the corner, they want a solution that they can apply before it gets really cold.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to give an overview of things that Europeans can do to start saving energy and money today – even if they rent a home. The focus is on homes using radiators and a boiler connected to a thermostat.</p>
<p>Heating is a complicated topic and you will probably still have questions after reading this post. Don’t hesitate to join the Home Assistant community to discuss how to save energy (do make sure to search before asking a question). Join us <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/energy/57">in the forums</a> in the energy category or come hang out in the #energy channel on our <a href="/join-chat/">Discord chat server</a>.</p>
<h2>Take control of your heating <a class="title-link" name="take-control-of-your-heating" href="#take-control-of-your-heating"></a>
</h2>
<p>Most of your energy usage goes into heating your house in the winter.</p>
<p>Gas is more efficient than electricity to heat your house, unless you have a heat pump. So don’t turn off your gas heating and replace it with an electric heater as it will cost you a lot more money.</p>
<p>There are two ways of saving energy with heating. The first approach is to invest in more efficient technology to generate heat and improve the home insulation to stay warm. Things like getting a heat pump, improving insulation and getting thicker windows. Those things are not achievable before winter kicks in, so they are out of scope for this post.</p>
<p>The second way of saving energy is to use less of it. Governments have been advising to lower the overall temperature of your home, but putting the temperature too low can get a little too cold. Instead, you can be smarter about how you heat your home by installing smart thermostats, temperature sensors and thermostatic radiator valves (TRV).</p>

</p>
<h2>Smart Thermostats <a class="title-link" name="smart-thermostats" href="#smart-thermostats"></a>
</h2>
<p>A thermostat works by measuring the temperature. If the current temperature is below the target temperature set by the user, it turns on the heating until the home is the right temperature.</p>
<p>If you’re renting your home, you can skip this section as upgrading a thermostat is generally not an option.</p>
<p>The way a thermostat can help you save the most energy is by controlling the boiler, and preferably the boiler temperature. Heating the water is what drives the energy usage, so you wouldn’t want the boiler to heat the water to a higher temperature than is necessary to reach your target temperature.</p>
<p>Thermostats measure the temperature from the thermostat device. If the thermostat hangs in the last place in your home that gets warm, it might be heating more than you need. A smart thermostat can help by allowing you to pair extra temperature sensors to report the temperature in different rooms in your home. This allows the thermostat to turn off the heating earlier.</p>
<p>An extra bonus feature of a smart thermostat with remote control is that you’ll be able to change the temperature if you realize that you won’t be home at the scheduled time.</p>
<p>If you’re going to be in it for the long haul and want the easiest solution, you should invest in a smart thermostat that is part of a heating/cooling ecosystem that also has an API. Optimizing heating energy use is complicated and not something Home Assistant is good at out of the box. Instead, let that be managed by the ecosystem. The API allows you to still observe and influence it from Home Assistant to integrate presence and other data points the ecosystem is not aware of.</p>
<p>If you want full control over every part of heating your home, you don’t need to take the ecosystem route and instead invest in locally controllable thermostats, temperature sensors and TRVs and tie them together with Home Assistant. <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/smart-heating-scheduler-for-home-assistant-extra-multi-zones-version/237966">Here is an example to get started.</a></p>
<h3>Recommended thermostats <a class="title-link" name="recommended-thermostats" href="#recommended-thermostats"></a>
</h3>
<p>It’s hard to give a single product recommendation here because there are so many different heating configurations and we are not aware of a single solution that works best in every case. Always check if the thermostat works with your boiler or other heating system you might use.</p>
<p>Home Assistant core developer Frenck researched this topic a couple of months ago for his own home and settled on <a href="https://www.plugwise.com/" rel="external nofollow">Plugwise<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>. It controls his boiler and radiators and has a local API to integrate with Home Assistant.</p>
<p>Another popular solution is <a href="https://homematic-ip.com" rel="external nofollow">Homematic IP<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>. It too has a local API to integrate with Home Assistant.</p>
<p>Here at Home Assistant we prefer devices that work locally. Any device that stores your data in the cloud will eventually need a way to recoup the cost of hosting your data. It also means that if the company goes out of business, the devices tend to stop working. However, we understand that your priority today is saving energy. If the above solutions don’t work well for your home, you can also consider <a href="https://www.netatmo.com" rel="external nofollow">Netatmo<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a> or <a href="https://www.tado.com" rel="external nofollow">Tado<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>.</p>
<p>We don’t recommend Google Nest because its ecosystem is not fully featured enough, as it does not support TRVs.</p>
<h2>Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRV) <a class="title-link" name="thermostatic-radiator-valves-trv" href="#thermostatic-radiator-valves-trv"></a>
</h2>
<p>A TRV will replace the existing knob on your radiator with a smart one. This works too if you rent: just swap the old knob back when you move out. Installation generally takes just 5 minutes.</p>
<p>A TRV works like the thermostat of your house, but at the level of your radiator: you set the temperature that you want to reach, and it will open/close your radiator to get to the controlled temperature.</p>
<p>Having a TRV allows you to tune the temperature in individual rooms based on your schedule and/or planned usage, like only heating up the bathroom in the morning and around bedtime.</p>
<p>TRVs should be used to opt a room in/out of heating. Because heating the water in your boiler is still the biggest use of your energy, you should not use TRVs to turn off all radiators in your home or to reduce the temperature throughout the home. This should be done at the boiler level (usually via the thermostat). Keeping your boiler at the right (and not too high) temperature required to heat your home to the desired temperature is the biggest energy saver move you can do.</p>
<h3>Recommended TRVs <a class="title-link" name="recommended-trvs" href="#recommended-trvs"></a>
</h3>
<p>All three smart thermostats that we recommended are part of a product range that include TRVs. If you went with one of those, we suggest you stick to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>There are two devices that we recommend. Both work independently but also have a local API to allow plugging it into Home Assistant.</p>
<h4>Shelly TRV <a class="title-link" name="shelly-trv" href="#shelly-trv"></a>
</h4>
<p>This device works standalone and does not require a hub. Battery life is claimed to be 2 years. It offers a local API and integrates perfectly with Home Assistant.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.shelly.cloud/shelly-trv-wifi-smart-home-automation?tracking=A7FsiPIfUWsFpnfKHa8SRyUYLXjr2hPq" rel="external nofollow">Buy Shelly TRV<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a> <em>(affiliate link)</em></p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="9M1EVjEaHfI" videotitle="Home Assistant Shelly TRV integration"></lite-youtube></p>
<h4>Aqara Smart Radiator Thermostat E1 <a class="title-link" name="aqara-smart-radiator-thermostat-e1" href="#aqara-smart-radiator-thermostat-e1"></a>
</h4>
<p>The new kid on the block as it was just released. This TRV can be controlled directly from Home Assistant using Zigbee or via the Aqara hub. The hub can be locally integrated with Home Assistant via the <a href="/integrations/homekit_controller/">HomeKit Controller integration</a>.</p>
<p>Note: The vendor claims the device will support Matter in the future. It is unclear from their documentation if the device will speak Matter over Thread or that it will require their hub to expose the device over Matter. Our money is on the latter as that’s how they do HomeKit too.</p>

<h2>Automations that can save energy <a class="title-link" name="automations-that-can-save-energy" href="#automations-that-can-save-energy"></a>
</h2>
<p>Once you’re able to control your thermostat and TRVs, you can start to save energy by automating your heating. Below are 5 useful automations to help with this.</p>

<h2>Wrap up <a class="title-link" name="wrap-up" href="#wrap-up"></a>
</h2>
<p>Sadly, there is no golden solution to save energy that works for everyone everywhere. I hope that the above overview and tips will help you through the winter.</p>

<h2>Welcome to the month of “What the heck?!” 2022! 🎉 <a class="title-link" name="welcome-to-the-month-of-what-the-heck-2022-" href="#welcome-to-the-month-of-what-the-heck-2022-"></a>
</h2>
<p><a href="/blog/2020/08/18/the-month-of-what-the-heck/">Two years ago</a>, we had the first month of “What the heck?!”,
and <a href="/blog/2020/09/19/summing-up-the-month-of-what-the-heck/">it was great</a>! So, this year, for the entire month of October,
we are doing it again!</p>
<p>Home Assistant is growing fast, and the development pace is high! Every month’s
release almost feels like a birthday present, full of new features and
improvements. But did everything turn out the way it should? Are there
things missing? Could it be <a href="/blog/2022/01/19/streamlining-experiences/">streamlined</a> more? Or, worse, maybe something
started annoying you?</p>
<p>That is what this month is about!</p>
<h2>Lowering the barrier for sharing WTH?! moments <a class="title-link" name="lowering-the-barrier-for-sharing-wth-moments" href="#lowering-the-barrier-for-sharing-wth-moments"></a>
</h2>
<p>We realize reporting bugs on our <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/new/choose" rel="external nofollow">GitHub<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a> might be a steep hill
and, for some, maybe even a bit scary (although you shouldn’t be). You need a
GitHub account, report an issue following issue templates and forms, and the
report itself needs to be written in a way a developer can work with it.
Above all, we use our issue tracker for tracking actual issues and bugs,
not small feature requests or annoyances.</p>
<p>While this is a common and reasonable process to collect, track, and process
bugs, our issue tracking process might not be the ideal way to learn about
your <em>“What the heck?!”</em> moments, small tweaks, and improvements that can make
us all enjoy Home Assistant even more.</p>
<p>Today, we have opened up a <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/what-the-heck/56">Community Forum category</a> as a safe, lower
barrier place to tell about your Home Assistant “What the heck?!” moments.
More importantly: discuss and vote on topics your fellow home
automators have brought up.</p>
<h2>What are we looking for? <a class="title-link" name="what-are-we-looking-for" href="#what-are-we-looking-for"></a>
</h2>
<p>Last week I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/Frenck/status/1571961147305218055" rel="external nofollow">sent out a Twitter message<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a> asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enlighten me 💡 The whole community would celebrate and be shedding happy
tears of joy if just this tiny little thing was added to Home Assistant…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The goal of that question: finding those little additions, annoyances,
inconsistencies, and more. Things that, if addressed, could make a
big difference or provide a more streamlined experience, making Home Assistant
even more enjoyable.</p>
<p>I’ve got a whopping 200+ responses to that <a href="https://twitter.com/Frenck/status/1571961147305218055" rel="external nofollow">tweet<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>, and the truth is: Most
of them are exactly what this month is about! I’ve picked a few of them to
show you what I mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Helper entity to add/sum multiple sensor values like multiple energy
metering sensors.</em>
(<a href="https://twitter.com/NoahM_M/status/1572216035452899331" rel="external nofollow">@NoahM_M<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>)</li>
<li><em>More of an app thing maybe, but moving the top dashboards view menu to the
bottom when on the phone.
(<a href="https://twitter.com/teachingbirds/status/1572105538288373761" rel="external nofollow">@teachingbirds<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>)</em></li>
<li><em>It be great if automations were aware that another process/interaction/human
had changed a setting. E.g., if I turn the lights back up, I don’t want the
auto-dimmer to continue auto-dimming.
“Abandon automation if the state is modified,” or something.
(<a href="https://twitter.com/jameswood/status/1571973440567123968" rel="external nofollow">@jameswood<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>)</em></li>
<li><em>Being able to select (using the mouse) the time period I want from a graph
instead of manually selecting hours/days from the dropdown would be a great
improvement in my humble opinion!
(<a href="https://twitter.com/WouterSchoot/status/1572505967023226888" rel="external nofollow">@WouterSchoot<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>)</em></li>
<li><em>Toggling two lights should put them all in the same state. So if 1 light is
on and 1 off, toggling them together should make them both on, then next
toggle turn both off.

</ul>
<p>These are great examples of the things we are looking for, the things we
should share this month.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to all the things that will be brought up!
And are hoping it will be just as <a href="/blog/2020/09/19/summing-up-the-month-of-what-the-heck/#so-what-was-fixed">successful as the previous edition</a>.</p>

So, when does Home Assistant trigger this moment for you?
</p>
<h2>Hacktoberfest 2022 <a class="title-link" name="hacktoberfest-2022" href="#hacktoberfest-2022"></a>
</h2>
<p>This is not just the month of “What the heck?!”, it is also the month of
“<a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/" rel="external nofollow">Hacktoberfest<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>”! 🎉</p>
<p><a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/" rel="external nofollow">Hacktoberfest<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a> is a worldwide, month-long celebration of open source. An event
open to everyone. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code,
documenter, or designer, you can help drive open-source projects,
like Home Assistant.</p>
<p>The idea is that open source projects will gather entry-level bugs,
features, and small improvements that current or future contributors can pick
up and address; The month of “What the heck?!”, is a great way to provide these!</p>
<p>By participating in Hacktoberfest and by contributing four GitHub pull
requests, you will complete the challenge and earn either a free t-shirt
or have a tree planted.</p>
<p>This year, just like previous years, Home Assistant is open to and welcomes
participants of Hacktoberfest ❤️</p>
<h2>FAQ <a class="title-link" name="faq" href="#faq"></a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“I have multiple things! Should I put all my stuff in a single topic?!”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>No</strong>, please create <strong>multiple</strong>, <strong>smaller</strong> topics. There is no limitation
on how many forums topics one can create for WTH. Each topic can be
voted on, picked up, and resolved. Having multiple things stacked in a single
forum topic makes resolving, discussing, and voting on them hard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“Is everything reported going to be fixed/addressed?”</em></strong></p>
<p>There is no guarantee that will happen. The goal is to lower the barrier to
report things for one month. Home Assistant mostly relies on contributors
to address or improve the project. However, we think collecting feedback
this way can tremendously help during <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/" rel="external nofollow">Hacktoberfest<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“I really want this new integration or add-on to be implemented, so I can
use my devices. Is this the right place for it?”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>No</strong>, this event is <strong>not</strong> for requesting new add-ons or device/services
integrations. Please use the <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/c/feature-requests/13">“Feature Requests”</a> forum category instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“My WTH topic is one of the top-voted ones, so it is going to be
fixed/addressed, right?”</em></strong></p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a contest. Voting will help with visibility and getting a
feeling of the impact the suggestion might have. However, it might be
difficult or too big to implement. Home Assistant mostly relies on
contributors to address or improve the project. A topic with lots of votes
is more likely to be noticed by a contributor, but it is not guaranteed
to be picked up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>“I’ve found a bug and am comfortable with GitHub. Where should I report my
issue now?”</em></strong></p>
<p>If you are comfortable with using GitHub, please, by all means, <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/new/choose" rel="external nofollow">file an issue
report on GitHub<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a> instead.</p>

<p>Home Assistant Core 2022.9! 🎂</p>
<p>If you don’t know yet, this month is Home Assistant’s birthday! 🎉🎉 On September 17th, 2013 <a href="https://twitter.com/balloob" rel="external nofollow">Paulus Schoutsen<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a> made the first commit for Home Assistant that started a snowball of Home Automation enthusiasts willing to contribute to the open-source project. 9 Years later, Home Assistant is actively used by more than 500,000 people and growing every day. Nabu Casa also turns 4 this month. Turning 4 years old and gaining a new full-time employee 🍄. This month it seems everyone was in the birthday spirit as we have a jam-packed release!</p>
<p>The automation engine is a big reason why Home Assistant has so many users. So in the spirit of <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2022/01/19/streamlining-experiences/">Streamlining Experiences</a>, we thought a revamp was due. You will notice some huge improvements to the look and feel of the Automation Editor that we think will greatly improve its usability. I know I for sure see a huge difference!</p>
<p>Now I know that everyone usually expects <a href="https://github.com/frenck" rel="external nofollow">@frenck<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a> to be writing these release notes, but he took a well deserved vacation! And now you are stuck with me. Zack 😀. I hope you enjoy the release and everything that was packed into it!</p>
<p>– Zack</p>

<p>Home Assistant Core 2022.8! 🏖</p>
<p>While many of you enjoy a well-deserved vacation around this time, it seems
like it didn’t slow down the development/contributions made to Home Assistant.
What a beautifully packed release this is again!</p>
<p>I’m super stoked about the added Bluetooth support, opening up a whole new
world of devices to Home Assistant. I’m even more excited about the new repairs
and supported brands features. Those are going to help out A LOT 😃.</p>
<p>Do you know what is really great about this release? All the major features and
changes announced in this release are a step forward to our current goal:
Streamlining experiences.</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>

<p>Today we are happy to announce our first Works with Home Assistant partner: Leviton!</p>
<p><a href="https://leviton.com" rel="external nofollow">Leviton<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a> is an American lighting, wiring device, and load control company. Their products can be found in almost every home across the United States. As a partner, they will work with Nabu Casa to make sure that their line of Z-Wave devices will work great with Home Assistant. This gives users the best experience and will continue to give a great experience with automatic firmware updates via Home Assistant.</p>
<p>Leviton Z-Wave devices work locally and integrate seamlessly with the Z-Wave integration in Home Assistant (Z-Wave stick required). As all connectivity is happening locally, status updates and controlling your devices happen instantly in Home Assistant. Each device that is connected to power will also act as a Z-Wave router to extend your Z-Wave mesh network.</p>
<img src="/images/blog/2022-07-27-leviton-partner/leviton-devices.jpg" alt="Leviton Z-Wave Products" class="no-shadow">
<br><br>
<p>Leviton Decora Smart Z-Wave Devices include their DZ6HD dimmer, DZ15S switch, ZW4SF Fan Speed Controller, DZPD3 Plug-in Dimmer, DZPA1 Plug-in Switch, and ZW15R Outlet. All of these devices can be found on their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leviton" rel="external nofollow">Amazon store<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>. These devices can then be used inside of your home to turn on the lights when you walk into a room, turn your bedside lamps on at a certain time, and much much more.</p>

<p>With Home Assistant, we integrate with over 1000 different APIs. The majority of these integrations are created and maintained by the Home Assistant community. Over the years a number of companies have stepped up to work with our community offering samples and engineering support. In a few cases, we saw companies pick up the maintenance of integrating their products in Home Assistant.</p>
<p>Sadly, a couple of times it happened that companies went silent after their initial contribution, causing users to be wondering why new devices are not being supported. We want to protect our users from investing in products for their homes that won’t work well with Home Assistant.</p>
<p>Today we’re introducing the Works with Home Assistant program to allow manufacturers to show their support and commitment to Home Assistant and its community.</p>
<p>The program requires manufacturers to maintain the integration of their products in Home Assistant, offer a good user experience, provide product samples and give us an engineering contact to escalate issues. In return, manufacturers will be able to use the “Works with Home Assistant” badge on their products and documentation. The terms of the Works with Home Assistant program are enforced in an agreement signed by both Nabu Casa and the manufacturer.</p>
<img src="/images/blog/2022-07-12-partner-program/partner-program-logos.jpg" alt="Do not use - old partner logos" class="no-shadow">
<br><br>
<p>With Home Assistant we are always working on educating our users about preferring local control and open standards when acquiring new products. This is also reflected in the “Works with Home Assistant” badges.</p>
<p>There are manufacturers that are creating products that integrate into Home Assistant using standards like Z-Wave, Zigbee, or Matter (soon). In these cases, the integration is maintained by the Home Assistant community and Nabu Casa. These companies can still become a member of the Works with Home Assistant program but are relieved from integration maintenance.</p>
<p>Products that are approved for the <a href="https://esphome.io/guides/made_for_esphome.html">Made with ESPHome program<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a> will be eligible to use the “Works locally with Home Assistant” badge as part of their Made with ESPHome membership.</p>
<p>For more information for manufacturers, see our <a href="https://partner.home-assistant.io">Works with Home Assistant portal</a>.</p>

and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEH-DxOsywg" rel="external nofollow">Let’s get loud!<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a> event
about bringing audio to the <a href="https://building.open-home.io/" rel="external nofollow">Open Home<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>.
If you have missed those, it is worthwhile to check those recordings out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, preparations are happening for the upcoming Matter and of course,
the soon-to-be-released <a href="/yellow">Home Assistant Yellow</a>! 💛 More about that soon™.</p>
<p>This release is definitely representing the “streamlining experiences”
motto we have been using. The performance improvements in this release are
once more: stunning! Furthermore, there are some wonderful new features to
explore too.</p>
<p>This release has the perfect mix! I’m sure there is something in here you
like. So without further due: Enjoy the release!</p>

<p>👋  Hi there, Home Assistant Core 2022.6!</p>
<p>The June release brings insights! Insights on how you are doing with your
energy usage, and insights into what all the devices in your home are up to!</p>
<p>But that is not all June has to bring. Besides this release and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVDex3IV44M" rel="external nofollow">the release party<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>,
we have two additional events lined up for you this month!</p>
<p>On June 15, we will be hosting a <a href="/blog/2022/05/29/matter-in-home-assistant-workshop-announcement/">Matter in Home Assistant workshop</a>!</p>
<p>The workshop will show you what we’ve been up to and allow you to actually test it out by adding your first Matter device to your own instance!
I’m excited for this one; I’ve ordered <a href="/blog/2022/05/29/matter-in-home-assistant-workshop-announcement/">the parts listed in the workshop details</a>
for myself 🤗.</p>
<p>The day after, June 16, the second event: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEH-DxOsywg" rel="external nofollow">Let’s get loud!<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a></p>
<p>This event is all about a new approach to home audio and music in an open
solution that values the Open Home. Join this event for the latest news and
audio demos from Home Assistant, <a href="https://esphome.io">ESPHome<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>,
<a href="https://raspiaudio.com" rel="external nofollow">Raspiaudio<iconify-icon inline="true" icon="tabler:external-link" class="external-link"></iconify-icon></a>, and… something new!</p>
<p>Also: Hi Jacqueline Raaflaub! 👋 Jacqueline has joined
Nabu Casa; she will help out with support and assist in moderating our community.
We are excited to have you, and welcome!</p>
<p>Anyways, this Home Assistant Core release is a nice release with a couple of
new features and lots of cleanups under the hood. Together with the upcoming
events, this is going to be one exciting month!</p>
<p>Enjoy the release (and upcoming events)!</p>
