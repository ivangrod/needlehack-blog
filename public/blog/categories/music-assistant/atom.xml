<p>Over the past several months, <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/">Music Assistant</a> has been hitting all the right notes with new features, greater stability, and a crescendo of contributors who keep pushing the project forward. If you‚Äôre <a href="/blog/2024/05/09/music-assistant-2/#what-is-music-assistant">unfamiliar with Music Assistant</a>, it allows you to merge your libraries from leading audio streaming providers and local files, letting you play them on the most popular smart speakers. Since our <a href="/blog/2024/05/09/music-assistant-2/">last update</a>, Music Assistant has had a couple of big releases, but our most recent might just be our platinum record üíø, with a lot of new functionality coming in version 2.4. In case you‚Äôve missed the last few updates, here are the biggest additions.</p>

<h3>‚ÄúSay My Name‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Optimized for Assist</h4>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/voice_ma.jpg' alt="audiobooks page"/>We should have called it Hi-Fi edition</p>
<p>The most recent release has some great advancements for <a href="/voice_control/">Assist</a> devices, like the <a href="/voice-pe/">Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition</a>. We‚Äôve been working closely with the <a href="https://esphome.io/">ESPHome</a> team to ensure the most optimal audio streaming experience, which has helped make Assist devices into very capable media players. The community has even added some great functionality to fully <a href="https://github.com/music-assistant/voice-support">control your media player with your voice</a>, including choosing songs, artists, and more. Voice Preview Edition has a high-quality DAC that provides very clean audio playback from its 3.5mm jack, allowing you to stream lossless audio to connected speakers (this $59 device puts some of my expensive Hi-Fi gear to shame!).</p>
<h3>‚ÄúAcross the Universe‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">External audio & Spotify Connect</h4>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/spotify_connect.jpg' alt="Spotify Connect on a Voice PE"/>Spotify Connect on Voice Preview Edition</p>
<p>Another feature in the latest release is support for ‚Äúexternal audio sources‚Äù, which can be provided either by players themselves (source control) or with plugins. The first plugin to deliver this functionality is Spotify Connect. It‚Äôs the easiest way to use Spotify with Music Assistant, and can be enabled on any player. This makes any Music Assistant supported device a Spotify Connect supported device (can confirm, Voice Preview Edition is great for this). <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/plugins/spotify-connect/">To get started</a> go to Music Assistant‚Äôs settings, add the Spotify Connect Plugin, choose the devices you would like it to use, and within Spotify you will see the device as a player. Just note, Spotify Connect requires a Premium account to work.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve got our sights set on adding even more plugins like this down the line (AirPlay, anyone?). We‚Äôre also hard at work making the whole setup process super simple, particularly for those using the Voice Preview Edition who might not need every single Music Assistant feature, but still want this simple casting capability.</p>
<h3>‚ÄúRadio Ga Ga‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Podcasts & Audiobooks</h4>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/audiobooks.png' alt="audiobooks page"/>The full book's progress is tracked, and chapters are clearly shown</p>
<p>Your library just got a whole lot bigger! Music Assistant now has native support for podcasts and audiobooks. For podcasts, several providers have been added, including <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/subsonic/">Subsonic</a>, <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/youtube-music/">YouTube</a>, and <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/podcastfeed/">RSS feeds</a>. Audiobooks can be added via two brand new providers: <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/audible/">Audible</a> and <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/audiobookshelf/">Audiobookshelf</a>, or imported directly from your local files. Audiobook playback presents the entire book as a single bar with dots showing each chapter (even if the book is separated into multiple files), allowing you to really track your progress. The entire core has been adjusted to keep better track of your progress through any media, so you will always resume where you left off.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/continue.png' alt="Continue listening section"/>The "Continue listening" section on the home page takes you back to where you left off</p>
<h3>‚ÄúNew Sensation‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">More players and providers</h4>
<p>Shortly after our last blog post, we added support for <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> which was one of the most requested additions in the comments. A couple of other new providers were added, including <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/ibroadcast/">iBroadcast</a> and <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/music-providers/siriusxm/">SiriusXM</a>. For new hardware support we‚Äôve added support for <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/player-support/bluesound/">Bluesound</a> players. If you have a provider or player you love and want to see it in Music Assistant, <a href="https://github.com/orgs/music-assistant/discussions?discussions_q=sort%3Atop">request it</a>‚Äîbut better yet <a href="https://github.com/music-assistant/server">join us in developing it</a>!</p>
<h3>‚ÄúAll About That Bass‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Equalizer control & features</h4>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/eq.png' alt="PEQ page"/>Make your own EQ settings or import pre-made settings for your speaker</p>
<p>When we released 2.0 there were basic bass and treble controls for devices, but with our new <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/audiopipeline/">configurable DSP</a> (Digital Signal Processor) you can now fine-tune your audio like never before. This includes input and output gain, along with a powerful <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/dsp/parametriceq/">parametric equalizer</a> that can be applied per player üìà. You can conveniently view the entire audio pipeline by clicking the quality indicator icon.</p>
<p><img src='/images/blog/2025-03-music-assistant/audio_path.png' alt="Music Assistants next big hit" class='no-shadow' /></p>
<p>Another useful feature added was a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/usage/#:~:text=Don%27t%20Stop%20The%20Music%20(DSTM)">Don‚Äôt stop the music</a>‚Äù mode that keeps music playing even once your queue finishes, playing similar songs from your library. Another way to keep the music playing is through lock screens and widget controls built into many popular operating systems, which can now control Music Assistant.</p>
<h3>‚ÄúMaster of Puppets‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Home Assistant improvements</h4>
<p>Home Assistant was always designed to work seamlessly with Music Assistant, and it‚Äôs only getting better. In the <a href="/blog/2024/12/04/release-202412/#new-integrations">Home Assistant 2024.12 release</a>, we gave the community a Christmas present‚ÄìMusic Assistant moved from HACS to being a native integration (<a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/integration/migrate/">please migrate if you haven‚Äôt yet</a>).</p>
<p>Many people now add all their players to Music Assistant first and then integrate Music Assistant with Home Assistant, eliminating the need to add each device separately. The most recent release added the ability to outsource any player control, including volume or turning it on/off, to a Home Assistant entity. There are other benefits to using them together, like Music Assistant <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io/integration/announcements/">resuming audio playback</a> after an announcement or using Assist to find and play a song (<a href="https://github.com/music-assistant/voice-support">with or without LLMs</a>).</p>
<h3>‚ÄúD-D-Don‚Äôt Don‚Äôt Stop the Beat‚Äù</h3>
<h4 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">More stable streaming</h4>
<p>One of the biggest goals for every release is to improve streaming stability across all providers and players. With every release, we‚Äôve been improving stability, and since our last post, we‚Äôve had a big influx of users who have been finding and helping squash bugs. There have been nice improvements to almost every provider helping with stability, speed, and quality. Just in the next patch release 2.4.3, we‚Äôve improved streaming performance on slower network connections. The goal is that the music never stops.</p>
<h2>‚ÄúPraise You‚Äù - üôè</h2>
<p>A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to this release‚Äîwhether through code, testing, or feedback. Your support keeps Music Assistant evolving into the ultimate tool for managing your music, on your players.</p>

    <updated>2024-05-09T00:00:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://ivangrod.github.io/blog/2024/05/09/music-assistant-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src='/images/blog/2024-05-music-assistant/art.jpg' class='no-shadow' /></p>
<p>Today, exactly five years ago, I, Marcel, started working on <a href="https://music-assistant.io/">Music Assistant</a>. What began as a quick script, to sync my playlists so I could switch between streaming providers, grew into a beast on its own.</p>
<p>Music Assistant is what I‚Äôd like to call a ‚Äúmusic library manager‚Äù ‚Äì it gives you full control of playing YOUR music on your players. Just like Home Assistant centralizes all your devices and services to work together, Music Assistant does the same with your music sources and smart audio-playing devices.</p>
<p>To just play with Music Assistant without reading what it is (yes, we know you!):

<h2>Rainbow Connection</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">What is Music Assistant?</h3>
<p><strong>Your music, your players.</strong> Click and play. It should be as simple as that.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2024-05-music-assistant/how-it-works.jpg'/>From source to Music Assistant to speaker</p>
<h4>Connect and play anywhere</h4>
<p>Music Assistant allows you to quickly connect some of the <a href="https://music-assistant.io/music-providers/">most popular streaming providers</a> like Spotify and Tidal, with your local media files. Importing your liked tracks, artists, albums, and playlists, all displayed with the correct artwork.</p>
<p>It supports the most ubiquitous <a href="https://music-assistant.io/player-support/">streaming protocols and devices</a> like Airplay, Cast and DLNA, letting you play media on almost any device - if an old speaker doesn‚Äôt support new services, Music Assistant can bring it back to life.</p>
<p><a href="#freedom-of-choice">Read more‚Ä¶</a></p>
<h4>Unified music library with advanced features</h4>
<p>Your local and cloud libraries will be seamlessly merged together. If you have the same track on multiple place, it will appear once while helping you find the highest-quality version. You can even have multiple accounts from the same provider, allowing everyone in the house to have their playlists in one place.</p>
<p>It can group supported players for synchronized playback. It also supports advanced playback features such as crossfade and volume normalization - regardless of whether the device supports them.</p>

<h4>Built for Home Assistant</h4>
<p>Connecting this with the Home Assistant integration - automation and voice control supercharges the whole experience.</p>

<h2>Start me up</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">How to install Music Assistant</h3>
<p>After many years of development and testing with the amazing community, we can finally say this is ready for daily use.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2024-05-music-assistant/start-me-up.png'/></p>
<p>Even though Music Assistant is an HA Add-on, it can be installed from start to finish via <a href="https://hacs.xyz/">HACS</a>. You simply install the integration, which will automatically install and manage the add-on for you. The integration allows you to control your devices with automations and voice control.</p>
<p><a href='https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon?addon=d5369777_music_assistant&repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmusic-assistant%2Fhome-assistant-addon' class='my badge' target='_blank'><img src='https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg' /></a></p>
<p><em>Music Assistant is distributed as a <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/addons">Home Assistant add-on</a> ‚Äì our way to easily extend your Home Assistant installation with third party applications. To install it as a Docker container, follow the <a href="https://music-assistant.io/installation/#tertiary-installation-method-docker-image">MA installation instructions</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Fight the power</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Why Music Assistant?</h3>
<p>I started Music Assistant out of frustration about the mainstream available options;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You buy into an all-in-one ecosystem (such as Sonos), and then it‚Äôs up to that ecosystem to decide which music sources to support now and in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You choose a music streaming provider, and then somehow that streaming provider decides where/how you play their music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to switch between streaming providers and keep your carefully curated playlists, regardless of which provider you want to play it with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You still have your CD music collection that you‚Äôve painstakingly ripped into high-quality files on local storage, and you want to play them, maybe even mix them with choices from streaming providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or maybe you fall into the category of users who don‚Äôt want any subscriptions and have a carefully curated local media collection you want to play on these shiny new playback devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When we pay for our music or devices, we shouldn‚Äôt be limited by arbitrary limitations. We are slowly moving into a world of greater walled gardens and more vendor lock-in, and it‚Äôs time we took back control.¬†</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2024-05-music-assistant/fight-the-power.jpg'/><i>Tidal on a Google Home</i></p>
<p>I spent a long time and a good bit of my money looking at existing solutions to fill these gaps. They were either expensive, closed, or lacked the home approval factor - or a combination of all of these.</p>
<h2>Freedom of choice</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Connecting any sources and play anywhere</h3>
<p>Music Assistant connects to your favorite streaming providers and local music files, letting you play them on almost any connected playback equipment from the past 20 years. It‚Äôs basically a translator of music protocol A towards speaker/player protocol B.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2024-05-music-assistant/freedom-of-choice.png'/></p>
<p>For instance, I have a traditional amplifier + speakers setup in my living room that allows for high-quality music playback, where I can sit down and hear every detail. I also have Sonos speakers in a very noisy kitchen and some DIY speakers that can only accept Airplay. I can play my music to all of these speakers without being tied down to any single ecosystem.</p>
<p>Some people might say that the best way to prevent all that frustration is by buying into an ecosystem like Sonos which takes care of this for you entirely. While I am a big fan of Sonos (and I will recommend them to friends and family for ease of use), I am not a big fan of the vendor lock-in that comes with it. If Sonos or a streaming service decide to part ways, I don‚Äôt have to be locked out of my music. Also, they don‚Äôt make speakers at every price point, meaning you don‚Äôt get the advantages of the new higher-fidelity or more affordable hardware out there.</p>
<h2>Come together</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Unifying all your music in one library</h3>
<p>In the same interface as I can stream my kids‚Äô music to their speakers, I can stream my Hi-Res favorites to my high-fidelity setup. It is an all-in-one interface. Gone are the days of needing five different apps to get playback going in multiple parts of the house or switching who is connected just to access their playlists.</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2024-05-music-assistant/come-together.png'/></p>
<p>When you search in Music Assistant, it searches all your libraries. Every streaming service, or the local files you add, are available to choose for playback.</p>
<h2>We are family</h2>
<h3 style="margin-top: -1em; opacity: .67;">Built for Home Assistant</h3>
<p>Music Assistant has always been closely linked to Home Assistant (more on that below). I now even work for <a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">Nabu Casa</a>, partly because of my work on Music Assistant (but now I‚Äôm the Matter guy).¬†</p>
<p class="img"><img src='/images/blog/2024-05-music-assistant/we-are-family.png'/></p>
<p>Because of this strong link, Home Assistant seamlessly links with Music Assistant, unlocking several advanced features. MA players are exposed to HA and can be controlled via your dashboards, automations, and scripts. This allows HA users to control their music players and access MA‚Äôs powerful music search function. Players can provide TTS (Text-to-Speech) announcements and can be controlled by Home Assistant connected voice assistants.</p>
<h2>Liner notes</h2>
<p>So, I started working on Music Assistant <a href="https://github.com/music-assistant/server/commit/75adea9721fa1f1b7225515087c81edd979fcc8f">exactly five years ago</a>, at first for my own personal use. It started as a learning exercise - thanks to it, I learned asyncio Python programming as well as the Vue frontend framework. I had the project on GitHub just to host the code, but it was not really meant to be used by others.</p>
<p>At some point, it became clear to me that there was a real demand, and I posted some info on how to install it, which gained a little attention. In June 2022, we released the 1.0 version of Music Assistant, and it was still in rough shape but already suitable for many users. We even organized a Livestream, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEH-DxOsywg">Let‚Äôs get Loud</a>‚Äù hosted by Home Assistant, to promote <a href="https://esphome.io/components/media_player/i2s_audio.html">audio support for ESPHome</a> and the super cool things you can build when you combine these three open-source projects.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 was not everything we hoped it would be. It had some structural bugs, specifically running as a custom component in Home Assistant. HA was created to give you the best experience for automating your home; it was never optimized for real-time audio streaming. On top of that, at some point, the dependencies of both projects got so conflicted that Music Assistant stopped working completely in the March 2023 release of HA.</p>
<p>Six months after its initial version 1.0 launch, the project was beginning to look like it was going to die, so I decided to start over and go back to the drawing board. The engine of MA needed to be its own isolated component, responsible for giving you the best possible experience of streaming music (where audio quality and latency are very important), and the HA-side should be responsible for automating your house and music.</p>
<p>So, the Music Assistant Server was born. It is a standalone application that you can run in docker (or Home Assistant add-on), all connected to HA via a HACS integration. The project was split up into multiple self-contained parts.¬†</p>
<p>Music Assistant Server has its own web interface, a modern interface written in Vue. Thanks to HA‚Äôs add-on system, this web interface can be securely accessed from HA. The web interface is a Progressive Web App (PWA), so you can also visit it directly and <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?hl=en-GB&amp;co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop">install it on your device</a>. We also have an (experimental) <a href="https://music-assistant.io/companion-app/">desktop app</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we have been iterating on this with an impressive number of beta testers. So, while technically this is a 2.0 release, to me personally this is the first real release, as this is finally something that feels good and has the right foundation. What is also super is that we attracted contributors to the project, folks helping create and maintain music integrations while providing support or translations. Even more exciting there are some really big features and streaming services on the horizon. My sincere thanks to everyone who has helped bring this release home.</p>
