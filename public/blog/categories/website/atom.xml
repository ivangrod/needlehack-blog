    <content type="html"><![CDATA[One of the main complaints that we receive is something along the lines "I read that X is possible yet I am unable to find it on the website.". This post is to announce that we have taken the first steps to improve it by revamping the [getting started] and [developers] sections. It's still a work in progress but we now have a solid foundation to build on for the future 👍.

Our documentation has been going through various phases. Initially it was just the README in our GitHub repository. I discovered Jekyll and GitHub pages in December 2014 and created home-assistant.io. I more or less broke the README in 5 pages and [called it a website]. Back then we had a whopping 11 components!

As Home Assistant grew, so did our documentation. [Fabian Affolter](https://github.com/fabaff) does an amazing job in making sure there is at least a documentation stub for each new feature that lands. And that's quite a feat given our [frequent releases](/blog/categories/release-notes/)! But despite all the efforts, the documentation outgrew our existing documentation organization.

Today it has been almost 1.5 years since we started the website. We now have [264 components and platforms] under our belt and have been honored with 1.5 million page views ✨. And hopefully we now also have documentation that our community deserves.

[getting started]: /getting-started/
[developers]: https://developers.home-assistant.io/
[called it a website]: /blog/2014/12/18/website-launched/
[264 components and platforms]: /integrations/

Finally, if you see some content that could use more clarifcation or is outdated, don't hesitate to use the 'Edit in GitHub' link that is present on each page.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[I finally took the time to setup a simple website to help people getting started with Home Assistant. The process was super smooth thanks to the great tools [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and the great services [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com).
