  - question: Where do I find support?
    answer: Support for Home Assistant software (and other Open Home Foundation projects) is done by community members who volunteer their time to help out fellow hobbyists. The most active communities for providing support are our <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/">community forums</a> and the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/home-assistant">Discord server</a>. Just make sure to follow the rules about where and how to post your support query. It is also possible to ask for support in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/HomeAssistant/">Facebook group</a> and on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/">Reddit</a>.
  - question: How can I contribute to the project?
    answer: <p>No matter your experience, there are plenty of ways to get involved and contribute to Home Assistant! If you’ve got the dev skills (whether you're a beginner or expert), <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/review-process#before-creating-your-pr">start here</a>, which shows you how to craft a PR, and then check out our extensive <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/development_index/">Core documentation</a> to help familiarize yourself with our architecture. There you will find instructions on how to join the Developers category in our Discord server, which allows you to chat directly with other developers.</p><p>If you're knowledgeable about how to use Home Assistant, don't be afraid to hop onto one (or more) of our community platforms to share this knowledge. This is a great way to contribute if you’re not a developer. Additionally, suppose you're a designer and are passionate about Home Assistant. In that case, we'd love for you to check out our <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/development_index/">Developers category in Discord</a> (Follow the steps to join the development server, and choose I want to contribute design skills!).</p><p>If you’re not able to give your time, you can also financially support the foundation, which pays passionate people to work on Home Assistant full-time. Subscribing to <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/cloud/">Home Assistant Cloud</a> or purchasing our officially licensed Home Assistant hardware supports the development of this project and <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org/projects/">many others</a>.
