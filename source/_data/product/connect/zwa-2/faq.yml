  - question: Why is the Connect ZWA-2 so big?
    answer: 'The Connect ZWA-2 was designed from the ground up to be perfectly tuned to the wavelength used by the Z-Wave standard. Many other Z-Wave adapters use the smaller USB “stick” form factor. These use tiny postage-stamp-sized antennas that can limit their ability to connect over distance. Getting the most out of Z-Wave requires a big antenna and base, and this allows Connect ZWA-2 to be one of the best-performing Z-Wave adapters on the market.'
  - question: Why is this called the Connect ZWA-2?
    answer: 'Connect ZWA-2 was built on our second-generation platform, which prioritizes high performance and openness in its design. It is a big leap from our first-generation Connect ZBT-1, and all Connect line products going forward will use this new platform. There is no ZWA-1, as we jumped directly to 2 to represent the generation of technology inside this adapter.'
  - question: Can I use Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long Range simultaneously?
    answer: 'Yes, it runs these networks simultaneously. If you’re not familiar, Z-Wave Long Range is not a mesh standard and builds a separate “star-type” network (<a href="https://z-wavealliance.org/what-is-z-wave-long-range-how-does-it-differ-from-z-wave/">more on the technology here</a>). This dual-mode operation allows you to have the best of both worlds — a strong mesh network based on older devices, and the reach of Long Range for the newest devices that support the latest standard. Whenever you connect a Long Range capable device to Home Assistant, the connection wizard will give you the choice between connecting it to your Z-Wave and Z-Wave Long Range networks.'
  - question: Should I always connect devices via Z-Wave Long Range?
    answer: 'There are times when connecting a device to Long Range makes the most sense (if it is far away from other devices, or that spot has had connection issues in the past), and times when using this new device to strengthen your mesh is more beneficial. Z-Wave Long Range also provides a more responsive connection, and with specific devices, more battery life. Try both out; you can always remove and pair the device again to switch which network it connects to.'
  - question: Can I migrate from any other Z-Wave stick?
    answer: 'You will be able to automatically migrate from most modern Z-Wave sticks. Detailed instructions and any special steps are available <a href="https://support.nabucasa.com/hc/en-us/articles/29529265751965">in our documentation</a>.'
  - question: How much range should I expect?
    answer: 'Every home and situation is different, and we can’t definitively say how far you can go with your devices. Our testing has found that with line of sight (so nothing in between), we were able to get 1.5 kilometers (0.9 of a mile) of range. In more real-world situations, our tests using Z-Wave Long Range were able to connect devices through several concrete floors. Indoors, we have seen 50-100 meters horizontally, but this also relies on the end-device having a good antenna. Our testers were most impressed by existing devices&#39; increased reliability and responsiveness.'
  - question: What regions does the Connect ZWA-2 support?
    answer: 'The Connect ZWA-2 supports all regions (there are no regional variations of this adapter, just one for the whole world). By default, it is set to the European region, and if you are using Home Assistant, it will set the region automatically based on the location details in your settings. If you’re not using Home Assistant, you may need to manually set the region and transmit power settings. You can find <a href="https://go.nabucasa.com/zwa-2-without-home-assistant">more information in our documentation</a>.'
  - question: Can I use the Connect ZWA-2 with other smart home platforms or custom Z-Wave add-ons?
    answer: 'Yes, you can. However, Connect ZWA-2 is optimized to work with the Home Assistant platform and standard Z-Wave JS. If you use it with another smart home platform or a custom Z-Wave add-on, you will miss Home Assistant-specific features such as easy migration or automated region setting. You will need to set up the adapter manually in the platform or add-on of your choice. You can find <a href="https://go.nabucasa.com/zwa-2-without-home-assistant">more information in our documentation</a>.'
  - question: Will this work with Z-Wave JS UI?
    answer: 'Connect ZWA-2 can work with Z-Wave JS UI, but Home Assistant will not be able to migrate your existing network automatically. In Z-Wave JS UI, you must back up your existing adapter and restore it on Connect ZWA-2. You will also need to manually change the frequency or transmit power settings via the UI. Detailed instructions are available <a href="https://support.nabucasa.com/hc/en-us/articles/29529265751965">in our documentation</a>.'
  - question: Why should Connect ZWA-2 always be placed upright?
    answer: 'For the best performance, place Connect ZWA-2 upright, away from any radio-blocking obstructions. Avoid placing Connect ZWA-2 on its side or mounting it sideways on a wall. There is even an accelerometer inside it to ensure people position it correctly, with the top status light blinking quickly if placed at a suboptimal angle.'
  - question: Does the Connect ZWA-2 run on ESPHome?
    answer: 'No, while the Connect ZWA-2 does contain an ESP32 chip, it does not run an ESPHome-based firmware. Though it includes a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth antenna, it is inactive. It uses the ESP32 chip as a USB controller. The firmware for the ESP32 in the Connect ZWA-2 is open source and can be <a href="https://github.com/NabuCasa/zwave-esp-bridge">found here</a>, and the firmware for the Z-Wave chip can be <a href="https://github.com/NabuCasa/zwave-firmware">found here</a>.'
  - question: Who manufactures the Connect ZWA-2?
    answer: 'Nabu Casa, a commercial partner of the Open Home Foundation, is the manufacturer of the Connect ZWA-2. A significant part of Nabu Casa’s revenue on Home Assistant-branded products is paid to the Open Home Foundation as a partnership fee. Purchasing products from commercial partners supports the Open Home Foundation and the development of all its projects, such as Home Assistant, Z-Wave JS, ESPHome, and Music Assistant.'
