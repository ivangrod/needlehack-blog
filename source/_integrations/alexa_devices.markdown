The **Alexa Devices** {% term integration %} lets you control Alexa-enabled devices connected to your Amazon account.

The integration provides information on connected devices and enables control of the main features.

To enable MFA, in your Amazon account settings select **Login & Security** > **2-step verification** > **Backup methods** > **Add new app**.

## Actions

### Available Actions

Available actions: `notify.send_message`, `alexa_devices.send_sound`, `alexa_devices.send_text_command`

#### Action `notify.send_message`

Devices with appropriate functionality will have speak and announce notify entities created. These can be used as the target for the `notify.send_message` action.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `message` | no | Text to be output (see below for advanced markup) |

{% tip %}
When sending notifications to multiple devices, you may experience delays due to rate limiting by Amazon. You can avoid this by sending notifications to speaker groups created in Alexa.
{% endtip %}

{% details "Advanced Message Markup" %}

Amazon provide markup to control not only what is said but how it is said and to add additional option such as pausing and playing certain audio clips.  Details of this are covered in [Amazon's documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml-reference.html) where there are lots of examples (just pass everything between the `<speak>` and `</speak>` elements into the `message` parameter of the action).

Audio files must meet certain criteria on size, bit and sample rates and must be served over HTTPS (see [documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml-reference.html#audio) for full details).  These restrictions make them fine for text and sound effects but you will not be able to play music this way.

Amazon provide a set of [sounds you can use](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/ask-soundlibrary.html) which contains the markup you will need for that clip.

{% enddetails %}

#### Action `alexa_devices.send_text_command`

This action essentially allows you to control Alexa using text commands rather than speech. You should be able to request anything you would via speech using this action.

| Data attribute | Optional | Description |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `device_id` | no | Device on which you want to run action |
| `text_command` | no | Command to send |

#### Action `alexa_devices.send_sound`

This action allows you to play one of the built-in Alexa sounds. The full list of sounds is available in [Amazon's documentation (needs authentication)](https://alexa.amazon.com/api/behaviors/entities?skillId=amzn1.ask.1p.sound)

| Data attribute | Optional | Description |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `device_id` | no | Device on which you want to play sound |
| `sound` | no | The name of the sound to play |

## Examples

```

### Using advanced markup in a notification

```yaml
action: notify.send_message
data:
  message: >
    Hello, lets have some examples.
    <amazon:emotion name="excited" intensity="medium"> This is me being mildly excited! </amazon:emotion>
    The farmer's dog was called <say-as interpret-as='spell-out'>bingo</say-as>.
    <prosody pitch='high'> I can sing high </prosody> <prosody pitch='low'> and I can sing low </prosody>
target:
  entity_id: notify.study_dot_speak
```

```yaml
action: notify.send_message
data:
  message: >
    Stop! <break time='3s'/> Hammer Time. Watch out
    <audio src="soundbank://soundlibrary/scifi/amzn_sfx_scifi_laser_gun_battle_01"/>
    Shields up! <audio src="soundbank://soundlibrary/scifi/amzn_sfx_scifi_shields_up_01" />
    <amazon:effect name="whispered">
      <prosody rate="x-slow"><prosody volume="loud">Enough now</prosody></prosody>
    </amazon:effect>
target:
  entity_id: notify.study_dot_speak

```
