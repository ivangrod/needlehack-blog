## Actions

The integration provides the following actions.

The `ohme.list_charge_slots` action is used to fetch a list of charge slots from your charger. Charge slots will only be returned if a charge is in progress.

| Data attribute         | Optional | Description                                                  |
|------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|

### Action: Set price cap

The `ohme.set_price_cap` action is used to set the price cap threshold. This can be toggled by the switch **Price cap**.

| Data attribute         | Optional | Description                                                 |

## Use cases

This integration enables several use cases to optimise efficiency of a solar and/or battery storage system.

### Solar charging
Use the charger mode to maximize solar consumption:
- Set the charger to "Paused" when solar production is low
- Switch to "Max charge" during peak solar hours

### Battery storage
If you have a home battery system:
- Charge your EV when the battery is above certain capacity
- Pause EV charging when the battery needs replenishing

## Examples

### Send a notification on status change

To be notified when the status of the charger changes, for example when a vehicle is plugged in, you can use an automation.

{% raw %}
```yaml
# Example automation
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      - sensor.ohme_home_pro_status
    from: unplugged
actions:
  - action: notify.mobile_app_iphone
    data:
      message: "Vehicle plugged in"
```
{% endraw %}


## Troubleshooting

### Entities are shown as unavailable
You may need to power cycle your charger. Please see the [manufactuer's guidance](https://ohme-ev.com/support/my-charger-is-offline/) for the procedure.

## Data updates

This integration fetches data every 30 seconds with the following exceptions:
- CT readings are fetched every minute.
- Device settings are fetched every 30 minutes.

## Known limitations

The integration does not provide the ability to manage vehicles or routines, which can instead be managed on the manufacturer's app.
