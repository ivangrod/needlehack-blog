The **Rehlko** (formerly Kohler Energy Management) {% term integration %} allows you to monitor the status of your [enabled Kohler generator](https://www.kohlerhomeenergy.rehlko.com/kohler-energy-management-app) through Home Assistant. This integration replaces the legacy Oncue integration.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Required manual input

To configure a Rehlko (Kohler Energy Management) account, enter the following information:

{% configuration_basic %}

email:
  description: "The email used to log in to the Rehlko (Kohler Energy Management) application."
password:
  description: "The password used to log in to the Rehlko (Kohler Energy Management) application."

{% endconfiguration_basic %}

The integration uses your generator's name as the device name and within your entity names. To change this name, it is recommended to do so in the Kohler app before configuring the integration.

## Binary sensors

This integration provides the following binary sensors to help you keep track of your generator's key states:

- **Auto run**  
  Lets you know if your generator will automatically start when there is a power outage.

- **Connectivity**  
  Shows whether your generator is currently connected to the Rehlko cloud.

- **Oil pressure**  
  Monitors the oil pressure sensor. If this sensor is *on*, it means there is a problem with the oil pressure.

## Sensors

The sensors exposed by this integration depend on the specific instrumentation installed on your generator and transfer switch. Sensor availability can vary significantlyâ€”even between units of the same model.

### Status sensors

Status sensors provide information about the overall state of the generator.

> **Note:** This list of values is not complete. If you observe new values, please report them by opening an issue.
