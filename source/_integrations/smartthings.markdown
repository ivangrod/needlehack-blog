[SmartThings](https://www.samsung.com/smartthings/) is a home automation platform for connecting with Samsung or third-party devices.

## Prerequisites

- You need a Samsung account and account credentials.
- To connect devices, you need the SmartThings app installed on your phone.

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

## Supported functionality

SmartThings represents devices as a set of [capabilities](https://developer.smartthings.com/docs/devices/capabilities/capabilities-reference). The SmartThings integration maps those capabilities to entities in Home Assistant. A single device may be represented by one or more entities.

### Button

The SmartThings Button platform provides stop buttons for devices with the `ovenOperatingState` capability.

### Climate

The SmartThings Climate platform lets you control devices that have air conditioner or thermostat related capabilities.

#### Air Conditioners

For a SmartThings Air Conditioner to be represented by the climate entity, it must have all of the following required capabilities. If it does not have all the capabilities, the features will be represented in Home Assistant as individual sensors instead of a climate entity.

### Scene

The SmartThings Scene lets you activate scenes defined in SmartThings. A scene entity is created for each SmartThings scene.

### Switch

The SmartThings Switch lets you control devices that have the [`switch`](https://developer.smartthings.com/docs/devices/capabilities/capabilities-reference#switch) capability that are not already represented by a more specific platform.

It will also create switches for the following capabilities:

| SmartThings capability       |
|------------------------------|
| `custom.dryerWrinklePrevent` |


### Update

The SmartThings update platform lets you update the firmware of devices that have the [`firmwareUpdate`](https://developer.smartthings.com/docs/devices/capabilities/capabilities-reference#firmwareUpdate) capability.

### Vacuum

The SmartThings Vacuum platform lets you control devices that have the `samsungce.robotCleanerOperatingState` capability, showing the vacuum status and controlling the device.

### Valve

The SmartThings Valve platform lets you control devices that have the [`valve`](https://developer.smartthings.com/docs/devices/capabilities/capabilities-reference#valve) capability, showing the valve status and opening and closing.

### Water heater

The SmartThings Water heater platform lets you control heat pumps that provide hot water.

## Troubleshooting

### Enabling debug logs and diagnostics

If debug logging is enabled, the integration shows all the received events in the logs. The log captures events for that device for 5 seconds, and return a JSON file with the state of the device and the events.
Debug logs can be helpful for diagnosing state updates, for example by selecting the button and then turning on the device physically.

- To enable debug logs, follow the [steps to enable debug logs](/docs/configuration/troubleshooting/#debug-logs-and-diagnostics).

## Removing the integration

{% include integrations/remove_device_service.md %}
4. Open the SmartThings app and delete the Home Assistant application from SmartThings.
