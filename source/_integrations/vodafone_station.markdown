## Examples

### Automation: reconnect / get new IP every night

```yaml
automation:
- alias: "Reconnect Vodafone Station (Fiber)"
  triggers:
    - trigger: time
      at: "05:00:00"
  actions:
    - action: button.press
      target:
        entity_id: button.vodafone_station_xxxx_reconnect_fiber
```

### Automation: notify connected device not home

```yaml
automation:
- alias: "Apple TV disconnect"
  triggers:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: device_tracker.appletv
      to: "not_home"
  actions:
    -  action: notify.mobile_app_phone
       data:
         message: "TV lost network connection"
```

### Automation: notify router CPU usage too high

```yaml
automation:
- alias: "Vodafone Station CPU high cpu usage"
  triggers:
    - platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.vodafone_station_xxxx_cpu_usage
      above: 80
  actions:
    - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
       data:
         message: "Router CPU above 80%."
```

## Data updates

This integration {% term polling polls %} data from the device every 30 seconds by default.

## Additional info

### Device tracker

**Note**: If you don't want to automatically track newly detected devices, disable the {% term integration %} system option `Enable new added entities`.

## Troubleshooting

### Canâ€™t set up the device

#### Symptom: "User already logged-in"

When trying to set up the integration, the form shows the message "User already logged-in".

##### Description

This means that there is already a logged session to the Vodafone Station router.

##### Resolution

To resolve this issue, log out from all active sessions, or, if the session was abruptly closed, wait for the router timeout (usually 60 seconds).

## Removing the integration

This integration follows standard integration removal. No extra steps are required.
