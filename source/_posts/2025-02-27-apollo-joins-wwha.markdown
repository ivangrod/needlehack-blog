[Apollo Automation](https://apolloautomation.com/) has joined the [Works with Home Assistant](https://partner.home-assistant.io/) program. Certifying three of their newest devices, including their community favorite presence and air quality multisensors, giving users the best possible experience when using these devices with Home Assistant.

Notably, these are the first [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/index.html)-based devices to receive Works with Home Assistant certification. Apollo is one of the first movers in an important trend that we're very excited about: Home Assistant community members turning their open projects into viable businesses that support a thriving Open Home ecosystem.

## Background

Apollo Automation is a growing family-run business rooted in the Home Assistant and ESPHome communities. And yes, they're named after their German Shepherd, Apollo üêï.

<div class="alert">
    <p>Apollo Automation is built by and for the Home Assistant community. We believe in open smart home technology that gives users control, privacy, and flexibility. Joining the Works With Home Assistant program is a natural step for us, ensuring our devices integrate seamlessly while supporting the ecosystem we love. Home Assistant allows users to create powerful smart homes, and we are excited to contribute by making high-quality, reliable hardware that enhances the experience for everyone.</p>

Two years ago, they started sharing their designs for a new impressively small ESPHome-powered multisensor with the community. Getting feedback, sharing iterations, and working collaboratively, they turned that sensor into a full-fledged product, which was built to work with Home Assistant. They have continued this open, community-first approach and have now built several even more refined multisensors.

Home Assistant is the [only true smart home platform](https://newsletter.openhomefoundation.org/true-platforms-let-you-create/) because it gives everyone full control to build and create. [ESPHome](/integrations/esphome/) is the ultimate smart device platform, and it is fostering an entirely new ecosystem of Open Home projects. ESPHome works fully locally, and it's a modder's paradise, allowing users to build DIY smart home devices (check out the [getting started with ESPHome guide](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio.html)).

Creators can also use it to build pre-built, plug-and-play products that give users a really seamless experience. With devices being discovered and easily added to your Wi-Fi network and Home Assistant, along with a one-click update within Home Assistant.

ESPHome and Home Assistant allows anyone to turn their passion for building cool things into a career, and the things they build help support a more vibrant Open Home. Apollo is an exciting new partner for the Works with Home Assistant program and should serve as an inspiration to all aspiring makers in our community.

## Devices
Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates, while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/), and it is the support of [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) subscribers that funds this work.

Apollo has chosen first to certify three products, which include:

- [MTR-1 Multi-Target Radar Multisensor For Home Assistant (LD2450)](https://apolloautomation.com/products/mtr-1) - A tiny, but powerful radar-based (mmWave) presence sensor that can pack in many other sensors.
- [MSR-2 mmWave Multisensor For Home Assistant (LD2410B)](https://apolloautomation.com/products/msr-2) - An even smaller multisensor that is the successor of the initial community feedback-driven design.
- [AIR-1 Air Quality Sensor For Home Assistant](https://apolloautomation.com/products/air-1) - A small air quality multisensor that can be extended to incorporate a huge variety of sensors.

We anticipate that Apollo will bring more of their lineup into the program, and we are excited to see their new innovations going forward! This is just the start of a year of many new Works with Home Assistant announcements, so please stay tuned!
