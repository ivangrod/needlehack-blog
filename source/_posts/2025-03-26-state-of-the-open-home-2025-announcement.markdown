🚨On April 12th, we're going live with this year's State of the Open Home - our annual recap of the previous year and look ahead to the next. Just like past years, this live stream will be packed with awesome announcements, updates, and cool community highlights. (*Got 11 hours to spare? Check out our last 5 [State of live streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKsVm4cWHDQBtg2CwzJVoCvx4Mc2yTy7C)!*)

This marks a full year since the founding of the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/) and Home Assistant becoming part of the foundation. We'll be taking a look back at what has been a very big year, and using this time to give you some big updates. These will include new projects becoming a part of the foundation 🚀, new supporters 🎉, and what's in store for our Works with Home Assistant program 🤝.

We'll also be highlighting some of the big findings of our [2024 Home Assistant survey](/blog/2024/12/16/community-survey-2024/), where over 8,500 of you told us about yourself, your homes, and how you use Home Assistant. We'll also announce Home Assistant's 2025 [roadmap](/blog/categories/roadmap/), and how your feedback is shaping the future of the Open Home.
