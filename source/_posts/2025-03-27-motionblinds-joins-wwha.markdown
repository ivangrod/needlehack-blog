We're excited to announce the latest partner to join the [Works with Home Assistant](https://partner.home-assistant.io/) program is [Motionblinds](https://motionblinds.com/)! And if you're wondering what type of products they provide, the clue really is in the name!

Motionblinds is the first Works with Home Assistant partner to certify smart window blinds. This brings us closer to a future where you can build a smart home exclusively with certified devices that give the best possible experience with Home Assistant.Â  Smart blinds integrated with Home Assistant unlock powerful automations, such as blinds opening when you get home, or closing sun-facing blinds on warmer days to keep your home cool. <!--more-->

## Shades of innovation

Motionblinds is a brand from Coulisse, a company from the Netherlands, that has been making window coverings for the past 30 years. Motionblinds are available worldwide and are known for their beautiful, customizable designs, coupled with smart technology. They not only provide all-in-one smart blinds, but also upgrade kits for your existing roller blinds, which is great for cutting down on waste.

## A window to the future

Motionblinds are definitely a leader in the smart blinds space and have partnered with [Eve](https://www.evehome.com/en) Systems, a leading provider of smart home devices, headquartered in Germany and part of ABB. This partnership brings Matter-over-Thread to their motors. Together, we have tested and certified these Matter-certified Eve Motionblinds. It's easy to tell which are part of Works with Home Assistant, as they'll include the "powered by Eve" badge.

Motionblinds that use Bluetooth and 433MHz technology will also be getting the 'Works With Home Assistant' treatment, as we're certifying motors that connect via the Motionblinds Matter Bridge (CM-55). This provides an excellent local way to connect this additional range of products to Home Assistant, allowing many more Motionblinds motors to give the best experience with Home Assistant. Check out our [Motionblinds integrations page](https://next.home-assistant.io/integrations/motionblinds_matter/) for a full list of the different motors that are certified. Be aware that standalone, Bluetooth-integrated blinds are not currently certified under the 'Works With' program.

Home Assistant was recently [Matter certified](/blog/2025/03/10/matter-certification/), and with these blinds certified to work with Home Assistant, end-to-end these devices are going to give a seamless experience. Every Works with Home Assistant product is tested by our team, works locally, and the brand promises to provide great long-term support.

### Which devices have been certified?

- [Roller Shades](https://motionblinds.com/products/roller)
- [Double Roller Shades](https://motionblinds.com/products/double-roller)
- [Venetian Blinds](https://motionblinds.com/products/venetian)
- [Honeycomb Shades](https://motionblinds.com/products/honeycomb)
- [Curtains](https://motionblinds.com/products/curtains)
- [Pleated Shades](https://motionblinds.com/products/pleated)
- [Vertical Blinds](https://motionblinds.com/products/vertical)
- [Roman Shades](https://motionblinds.com/products/roman)
- [Upgrade Kit for Roller Blinds](https://motionblinds.com/products/upgrade-kit)

All these devices connect directly to Home Assistant via Matter, provided you pick the "powered by Eve" option, or combine with the Matter bridge. We're big fans of open standards like Matter, because they bring great benefits when it comes to local control, privacy, and long-term support.

## Closing thoughts ðŸªŸ

A big thanks to both Coulisse and Eve for putting their time and effort into bringing Motionblinds to the Works with Home Assistant program. This is really plugging a blind spot in our Works with program by covering new ground and opening up some exciting options for our community ðŸ˜ƒ.
