Our [Works with Home Assistant](https://works-with.home-assistant.io/) program is expanding once again, and this time we’re excited to announce Zooz is joining us! We have tested many new devices of all different types, ensuring they provide the best experience possible with Home Assistant. As well as classic staples for the smart home, they also bring some very cool flood protection devices to help safeguard your home.

These will be the first certified [Z-Wave](/integrations/zwave_js/) devices added to the program in some time, and are just part of the exciting future the Home Assistant community and Zooz see for this smart home protocol.<!--more-->

## Zooz zooms in

Zooz started out not as a manufacturer, but as a retailer of smart devices. They focused so much on customer support that they soon realized they could do a better job than manufacturers already in the market, and so turned instead to creating their own products. They focus on Z-Wave for its interoperability and security, and they include easy-to-understand installation guides with these devices. They also have a wide knowledge base on their website and a very responsive support team.

As Z-Wave experts, they’re members of the Z-Wave Alliance (where [Paulus is also a member](/blog/2024/09/24/we-are-joining-the-z-wave-alliance-board/) as the voice of the open source community). While Zooz is based in the USA, many of their products are available worldwide.

## It takes Zooz

Zooz has really embraced the Home Assistant community. Agnes, their VP of Brand and Partnership Support, recently spoke to the team over at the Home Assistant podcast about their startup journey. She also came along to our Community Day in Brooklyn, hosted by our very own Product Lead, [Madelena](https://github.com/madelena). It’s awesome to see manufacturers get out and connect with our community members.

<div class="alert">
    <p>"Zooz has been contributing quality hardware to the smart home community for over 10 years now and our biggest takeaway is that thoughtful integration is key for our customers. We recognize that our devices are part of an ecosystem and that's why we are so excited to partner with Home Assistant, a platform we highly respect for its commitment to making products work together seamlessly. I especially appreciate how quickly Home Assistant embraced Z-Wave Long Range and how easy it is to set up Z-Wave on a brand new system thanks to hardware like Home Assistant Green. We look forward to connecting with the Home Assistant community, learning together, and creating new devices driven by your feedback."</p>

## Devices

In case you didn’t know, Works with Home Assistant differs from other certification programs as products are rigorously tested in-house to ensure they work seamlessly out of the box. Any company joining also commits to providing long-term support and firmware updates while being a positive force in the Home Assistant community. Works with Home Assistant is operated by the [Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/), and the support of [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/) subscribers funds this work.

Zooz has had a large group of devices certified, one of the largest number of devices we’ve ever certified for a launch into the program. Kudos to the foundation team, and Zooz for making such a great variety of new devices available to our community.

## Frequencies and firmware

If you’re based in North America, all new devices will come with Z-Wave Long Range (ZWLR) as standard. If you are based elsewhere, like in Europe, Long Range won’t be enabled quite yet. The reason is that even though the Z-Wave Long Range protocol has been available for some time in North America, it was only released in Europe in April 2025, as certification took a bit longer. The nice thing about Zooz’s North American 700 series and European 800 series Z-Wave, is that ZWLR can be enabled via an over-the-air (OTA) firmware update, so hopefully everyone will be taking part in the Z-Wave Long Range revolution soon. Watch this space for a not-so-secret Home Assistant Z-Wave hardware announcement coming your way…

Z-Wave Long Range opens up a whole new world of options and makes for an even more flexible smart home. Maybe you have a large backyard, or an awkwardly shaped long, but narrow home that is hard to get other protocols to cover adequately. Or perhaps you have devices that are just too far away for other protocols. A common example is wanting a way to get notified when the mailbox at the front of your driveway is opened or closed.

Many of the certified devices can function outdoors or be purchased with accessories to make them waterproof. Speaking on a personal note, we had a leak in our garage a year or so ago after some bad weather. Other protocols couldn’t reach that far, and we had no way to be notified. I cannot wait for an easy way to be notified across that bigger distance, and avoid all the unpleasant clean-up.

It’s great to read stories on social media or our forums where smart home devices have kicked in and saved the day, like getting that all-important notification or cutting off the water supply with something like Zooz’s valve actuator.

<lite-youtube videoid="7k8Vm-CVhmg" videotitle="Video of the valve actuator"></lite-youtube>

Z-Wave, like other open standards we support, works locally, and all of the devices listed above will work locally, without the need for any extra cloud connection or apps. Remember, if you’re also looking for remote access to make sure you don’t miss any critical notifications while you’re away from home, an easy way to get this set up is to subscribe to [Home Assistant Cloud](/cloud/). Not only will this help you monitor your smart home remotely, but you’ll also be supporting the development of Home Assistant.

## FAQs

**Q: If I have a device that is not listed under "Works with Home Assistant" does this mean it’s not supported?**

A: No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function perfectly well, but be added to the testing schedule later down the road, or it might work under a different connectivity type that we don’t currently test under the program.

**Q: OK, so what’s the point of the Works with program?**

A: It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that the devices must have the expected functionality within Home Assistant, operate locally without the need for cloud, and will continue to do so long-term.

**Q: How were these devices tested?**

A: All devices in this list were tested using a standard HA Green Hub with our Z-Wave Integration. If you have another hub integration that’s not a problem, but we test against these as they are the most effective way for our team to certify within our ecosystem.

**Q: Will you be adding more Zooz devices to the program?**

A: Absolutely! We’re thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at Zooz to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here.
