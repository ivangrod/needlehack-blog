While we recommend using the {% term "Home Assistant Operating System" %}, you can also use the {% term "Home Assistant Container" %} method to install Home Assistant. Before you continue, be aware of the limitations and differences compared to the {% term "Home Assistant Operating System" %}. You can find more information on the [installation page](/installation/#about-installation-methods). Most notably,
