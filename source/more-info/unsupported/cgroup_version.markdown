## The issue

Supervisor prefers CGroups version 2 as it depends on its features to work properly.

It seems that on your system CGroups is not available or an unknown CGroups version is in use.

## The solution

Make sure CGroups v2 is available and enabled on your operating system.

You should never see this issue on Home Assistant OS as all versions of the OS
ship with a supported CGroup version.
